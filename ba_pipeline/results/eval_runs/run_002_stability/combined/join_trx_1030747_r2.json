  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The model flag is primarily driven by payment_format_ach = 1, which strongly increases the score (feature: payment_format_ach; SHAP +2.95104).\n- A relatively large value for amount_received (56984.0) increases the score (feature: amount_received; SHAP +0.746488).\n- The transaction occurred on dayofweek = 6 (Sunday), which increases the score (feature: dayofweek; SHAP +0.689965).\n- Payment and receiving currency indicators for Saudi Riyal increase the score (feature: payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1, SHAP +0.526883; feature: receiving_currency_saudi_riyal = 1, SHAP +0.271559).\n- Some features slightly reduced the score: from_bank (ID 249176) and to_bank (ID 49508) have negative contributions (feature: from_bank, SHAP −0.325773; feature: to_bank, SHAP −0.266182), but these reductions did not offset the positive drivers above.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based solely on the listed drivers, the transaction was flagged because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach = 1) in Saudi Riyals involving a sizeable received amount (amount_received = 56984.0) executed on dayofweek = 6 (Sunday); these factors jointly increased the model score. The sending and receiving bank IDs (from_bank, to_bank) modestly decreased the score but were insufficient to negate the positive contributions.\n- Conditional/hedged observation: if ACH format and Saudi Riyal currency co-occur with higher amounts and weekend timing (as seen in these drivers), the model is more likely to flag the transaction.",
