  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 — The transaction being ACH is the single largest contributor to the flag (SHAP +2.90216, direction: increase).\n- amount_received = 15968.2 — A receiving amount of 15,968.2 increases the model score (SHAP +0.899807, direction: increase).\n- amount_paid = 15968.2 — The payment amount of 15,968.2 also increases the score (SHAP +0.764144, direction: increase).\n- dayofweek = 6 — The transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) increases the score (SHAP +0.781602, direction: increase).\n- from_bank = 908 — The sending bank ID 908 decreases the score (SHAP −0.922438, direction: decrease).\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) combined with a relatively large amount (amount_received and amount_paid ≈ 15,968.2) occurring on a Sunday (dayofweek = 6), which together raised the risk score. The sending bank (from_bank = 908) partially offsets the signal but not enough to prevent the flag. If further review is needed, it would be reasonable to focus on the ACH nature and the high amount on a weekend, given the drivers above.",
