  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.87879, direction: increase): the largest single contributor — the model strongly raised the score because the payment was an ACH (electronic transfer).\n- dayofweek = 6 (SHAP +0.621813, direction: increase): the transaction occurred on day 6 (per fact sheet mapping, Sunday), which increased the score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 (SHAP +0.606203, direction: increase): use of Saudi Riyal as the payment currency increased the score.\n- amount_received = 31783.0 (SHAP +0.295498, direction: increase): the received amount contributed a modest increase to the score.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 (SHAP +0.268666, direction: increase): the receiving currency being Saudi Riyal further increased the score.\n- Offsetting factors: from_bank = 119 (SHAP −0.428745, direction: decrease) and to_bank = 49365 (SHAP −0.304935, direction: decrease) reduced the overall score contribution from the above features.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged the transaction primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach = 1) in Saudi Riyals (payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal = 1), occurring on dayofweek = 6, with a nontrivial amount_received = 31783.0; these features increased the risk score, while the specific from_bank and to_bank IDs partially offset that increase.\n- Conditional suggestion (derived from the named drivers): if further review is required, focus checks on ACH characteristics, the timing (dayofweek = 6), currency (Saudi Riyal), and the amount (31783.0), since these are the drivers that increased the model score. This note does not assert wrongdoing—only explains the model drivers.",
