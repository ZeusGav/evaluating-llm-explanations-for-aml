  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — strongest driver (SHAP 2.95104, direction: increase). The ACH payment format is the primary contributor to the flag.\n- amount_received (value=56984.0) — (SHAP 0.746488, direction: increase). The sizable received amount raises the model score.\n- dayofweek (value=6) — (SHAP 0.689965, direction: increase). The transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) contributes to increased score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — (SHAP 0.526883, direction: increase). Use of Saudi Riyal as the payment currency increases the model score.\n- from_bank (value=249176) — (SHAP -0.325773, direction: decrease). The sending bank ID modestly reduces the model’s suspicion.\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) with a relatively large amount_received (56984.0), processed on dayofweek=6 (Sunday), and denominated in Saudi Riyal (payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1); the sending bank (from_bank=249176) slightly offsets the risk signal. Recommendation: subject the item to manual review focusing on ACH routing details, justification for the amount, timing (Sunday processing), and verification of the sending bank identity.",
