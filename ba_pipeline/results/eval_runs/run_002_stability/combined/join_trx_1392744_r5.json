  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — large positive contribution (SHAP +2.87879, direction: increase). The model’s top driver indicates the ACH payment format strongly increased the alert score.\n- dayofweek (value=6) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.621813, direction: increase). The transaction occurring on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) raised the score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.606203, direction: increase). Use of Saudi Riyal as the payment currency increased the score.\n- amount_received (value=31783.0) — modest positive contribution (SHAP +0.295498, direction: increase). The received amount contributed to a higher score.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — modest positive contribution (SHAP +0.268666, direction: increase). The receiving currency being SAR further increased the score.\n- from_bank (value=119) — negative contribution (SHAP −0.428745, direction: decrease). The sending bank ID reduced the alert score.\n- to_bank (value=49365) — negative contribution (SHAP −0.304935, direction: decrease). The receiving bank ID also reduced the alert score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag is primarily driven by payment_format_ach=1 (strongest driver) combined with timing (dayofweek=6) and currency (payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 / receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1), with the transaction amount (31783.0) adding further upward influence. The sending and receiving bank identifiers (from_bank=119, to_bank=49365) partially mitigated the score but did not offset the increases from ACH, weekend timing, currency, and amount. If ACH transfers in SAR on dayofweek=6 or for amounts at this level are atypical for the customer or channel, these factors likely explain the model’s alert and merit review.",
