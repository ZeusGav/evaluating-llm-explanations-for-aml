  "llm_text": "Why: The model flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach = 1 (strongly increases score), combined with a high transaction size (amount_received = 16206.4 and amount_paid = 16206.4, both increasing the score). The transaction occurring on dayofweek = 6 (Sunday) also increases the score. These four features are the largest contributors to the model output.\n\nConclusion: The alert is consistent with an ACH transfer of ~16206 (same paid/received amount) executed on a Sunday, which collectively raised the model risk score. Note: to_bank = 25981 had a modest negative contribution (reduced score), which slightly offsets but does not negate the above drivers.",
