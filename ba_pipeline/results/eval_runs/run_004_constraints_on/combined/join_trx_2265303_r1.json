  "llm_text": "Why: The model flagged the transaction mainly because payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.80486, direction=increase) strongly raised the score, combined with large amounts: amount_received (16586.3; SHAP=+1.14535, direction=increase) and amount_paid (16586.3; SHAP=+0.674154, direction=increase). Timing on dayofweek (6, Sunday; SHAP=+0.713298, direction=increase) further increased the score. The from_bank feature (from_bank=11471; SHAP=-0.807652, direction=decrease) partially reduced the overall signal.\n\nConclusion: The alert is driven principally by ACH method and relatively high, symmetric payment amounts, with Sunday timing adding risk weight; however the sending bank (from_bank=11471) lowers the modeled risk. Conditional on these named features, review of ACH details and the counterparty bank may be the next relevant steps.",
