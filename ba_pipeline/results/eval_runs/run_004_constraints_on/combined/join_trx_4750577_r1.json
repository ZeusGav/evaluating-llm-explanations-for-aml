  "llm_text": "Why: The model score is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1) which strongly increases the flag (SHAP +2.85195). Large, equal send/receive amounts (amount_paid = 8884.75, SHAP +0.83633; amount_received = 8884.75, SHAP +0.734996) further increase the score. The transaction occurring on dayofweek = 6 (Sunday) also increases the score (SHAP +0.716852). The sending bank (from_bank = 29251) contributes a decrease to the score (SHAP −0.513975), partially offsetting the increases.\n\nConclusion: Net model signal is elevated, mainly because payment_format_ach and the sizable, identical amount_paid/amount_received on dayofweek=6 increase risk. The from_bank feature reduces the score but does not fully negate the increase. If triaging, prioritize review of ACH details and bank identifiers given these drivers.",
