  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP 2.89316, direction: increase): the use of ACH is the single largest driver raising the alert score.\n- amount_paid = 5183.46 (SHAP 0.803789, direction: increase): a relatively large paid amount further increases the score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (Sunday) (SHAP 0.73198, direction: increase): transaction occurring on Sunday adds to the model’s risk signal.\n- receiving_currency_euro = 1 (SHAP -0.249707, direction: decrease): receiving in EUR slightly offsets the score but does not outweigh the increases above.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because payment_format_ach, amount_paid (5183.46), and dayofweek (6/Sunday) collectively raised the model score; receiving_currency_euro modestly reduced it. If needed, prioritize review of ACH activity and transactions of similar size occurring on weekends.",
