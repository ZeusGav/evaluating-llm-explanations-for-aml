  "llm_text": "Why: The flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP +3.03902), meaning an ACH payment strongly increased the model score. Larger transaction size contributed: amount_received (16093.5; SHAP +0.928357) and amount_paid (16093.5; SHAP +0.627656) increased the score. Receiving bank (to_bank=23; SHAP +0.697119) also pushed the score up. The sending bank (from_bank=12; SHAP -1.11777) partially reduced the score.\n\nConclusion: The model flagged this transaction mainly because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) with relatively large paid/received amounts and an elevated contribution from the receiving bank (to_bank). The negative contribution from from_bank partly offsets but does not negate the overall signal. Consider focusing review on the ACH payment and the counterparty bank details.",
