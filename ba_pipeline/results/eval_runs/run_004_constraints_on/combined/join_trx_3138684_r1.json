  "llm_text": "Why:\nThe model flagged this transaction primarily because payment_format_ach (value=1) strongly increases risk (SHAP +2.81896, direction: increase). Large monetary values also contributed: amount_received (10066.5) increased score (SHAP +1.00155) and amount_paid (10066.5) increased score (SHAP +0.769784). The identical amount_received and amount_paid (both 10066.5) is a notable model input driving the increase.\n\nConclusion:\nBased solely on these drivers, the flag is driven mainly by an ACH payment method plus relatively large, matching payment/receipt amounts. from_bank (SHAP −0.276167) and to_bank (SHAP −0.216954) slightly decreased the score, partially offsetting risk. If further review is needed, focus on ACH details and the rationale for the matching ~10,066.5 amount.",
