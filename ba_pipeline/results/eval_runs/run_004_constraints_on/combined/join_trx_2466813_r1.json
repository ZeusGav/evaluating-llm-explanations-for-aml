  "llm_text": "Why: The flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach=1 (SHAP 3.14105, direction: increase) — the ACH method is the strongest positive contributor. Large transaction size also increases the score: amount_received=14606.0 (SHAP 1.20612, increase) and amount_paid=14606.0 (SHAP 0.878443, increase). from_bank=12 (SHAP -0.906024, direction: decrease) reduces the score and partially offsets risk, while to_bank=1 (SHAP 0.396424, increase) provides a smaller upward effect.\n\nConclusion: The model flagged the transaction mainly because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) combined with sizable amounts (amount_received and amount_paid at 14,606), with a modest additional contribution from to_bank; the from_bank feature lowers the score but does not fully negate the increase.",
