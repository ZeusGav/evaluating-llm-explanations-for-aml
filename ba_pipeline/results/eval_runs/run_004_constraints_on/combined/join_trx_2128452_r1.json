  "llm_text": "Why: The model’s largest positive contributor is payment_format_ach (value=1) — SHAP +3.06 — indicating ACH format strongly increased the score. Additional increasing drivers were dayofweek (value=6, i.e., Sunday) — SHAP +0.88 — and payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — SHAP +0.79. receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) also modestly increased the score (SHAP +0.28). Partially offsetting these were from_bank (value=119) — SHAP −0.57 — and hour (value=4) — SHAP −0.55, which decreased the score.\n\nConclusion: The alert is primarily driven by an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) occurring on dayofweek=6 and involving Saudi riyal as payment and receiving currency. These factors collectively raised the model score despite mitigating contributions from from_bank=119 and hour=4. If ACH activity in SAR on dayofweek=6 is atypical for this customer or channel, further review is warranted.",
