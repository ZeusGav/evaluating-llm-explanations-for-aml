  "llm_text": "Why: The model flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.68416), indicating an ACH payment strongly increased the score. Large monetary size also contributed: amount_received = 19426.8 (SHAP +1.0768) and amount_paid = 19426.8 (SHAP +0.531365) both increase the score. Dayofweek = 5 (SHAP +0.473488) further pushed the score up (transaction occurred on day index 5).\n\nConclusion: The transaction was flagged mainly because it is an ACH payment of relatively high value (equal amount received/paid) occurring on dayofweek = 5. Note: from_bank = 23402 has a negative contribution (SHAP −0.345949), which partially offsets risk but is insufficient to overcome the positive drivers.",
