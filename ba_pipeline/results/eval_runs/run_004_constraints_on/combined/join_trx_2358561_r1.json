  "llm_text": "Why: The flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.88604, direction: increase), meaning an ACH payment strongly raised the score. Large transaction size also increased risk: amount_received = 13966.5 (SHAP +0.757027, increase) and amount_paid = 13966.5 (SHAP +0.661095, increase). Receiving bank (to_bank = 1547, SHAP +0.31414, increase) further pushed the score up. Receiving_currency_euro = 1 had a mitigating effect (SHAP -0.271524, direction: decrease).\n\nConclusion: The model flagged this transaction mainly because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) with relatively large, equal amount_received and amount_paid into to_bank 1547; the euro receiving currency slightly reduced the signal. If proceeding, prioritize review of the ACH payment details and beneficiary bank (to_bank = 1547) given the elevated model contribution from those features.",
