  "llm_text": "Why:\nThe model flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1) which strongly increases the score (SHAP +2.87783). Elevated amounts — amount_received (14365.3, SHAP +0.84169) and amount_paid (14365.3, SHAP +0.78725) — further increase the score. The receiving bank (to_bank = 12, SHAP +0.49152) and dayofweek (5, SHAP +0.43074) contribute additional upward pressure. The sending bank (from_bank = 22758) modestly decreases the score (SHAP −0.64353), partially offsetting risk.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged because an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) combined with mid‑five‑figure amounts (amount_received/amount_paid ≈ 14,365.3) and the specific receiving bank (to_bank=12) on dayofweek=5 produced a higher model score. If ACH and these amounts are accurate, the model’s signal is consistent; the from_bank (22758) reduced but did not negate the overall increase.",
