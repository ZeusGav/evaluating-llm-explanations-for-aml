  "note": "The only major issue is an unsupported claim mapping dayofweek=5 to Saturday (per fact sheet, 5 corresponds to Saturday only if 0=Mon..6=Sun implies 5=Sat? actually 5=Sat is correct—wait: 0=Mon,1=Tue,2=Wed,3=Thu,4=Fri,5=Sat,6=Sun; supported—so biggest issue is mentioning “verify ACH routing” which is not supported by any provided feature."
