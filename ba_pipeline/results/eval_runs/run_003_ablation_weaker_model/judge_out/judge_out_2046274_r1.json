  "note": "The main issue is an unsupported claim: it states dayofweek=5 is Saturday, but the provided scale indicates 5=Saturday is incorrect (0=Mon..6=Sun implies 5=Saturday? actually 5=Saturday is correct? wait 0=Mon ->5=Sat, so supported), however it also recommends source/destination validation and purpose documentation which are procedural suggestions not supported by drivers."
