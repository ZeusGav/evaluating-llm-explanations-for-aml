  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The flag is primarily driven by payment_format_ach (value=1) with a large positive SHAP contribution (shap_value=2.8279), indicating ACH as the payment method strongly contributed to risk in this case.\n- The transaction has a large, matching pair of amounts for receive and pay (amount_received=17441.1 and amount_paid=17441.1) with substantial positive SHAP contributions (0.919704 and 0.592573 respectively). This pattern of a large, mirrored value increases the model’s risk signal.\n- The funds are moving toward a specific receiving bank (to_bank=1467) with a positive SHAP contribution (0.29306), further amplifying risk per the model.\n- Day of week also contributes modestly (dayofweek=1, shap_value=0.0998746), adding a small incremental risk signal.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based on the listed drivers, the transaction shows a model-driven elevated AML risk signal driven by ACH payment format, a large mirrored transfer value, and movement to a specific bank. The day-of-week signal adds a minor, supporting risk signal. This pattern warrants standard AML investigation and review of source-of-funds, beneficiary details, and consistency with expected business activity.",
