  "llm_text": "Why\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP_value=2.68416; direction: increase)\n  - The ACH payment format contributes the largest positive signal, indicating the transaction uses an ACH method, which is a strong driver of the flag in this dataset.\n- amount_received (value=19426.8; SHAP_value=1.0768; direction: increase)\n  - A large inflow amount is contributing positively to the flag, suggesting a sizable receipt in the receiving currency.\n- amount_paid (value=19426.8; SHAP_value=0.531365; direction: increase)\n  - The identical large outflow amount also contributes positively, which together with the inflow implies a large transfer of equal value.\n- dayofweek (value=5; SHAP_value=0.473488; direction: increase)\n  - The transaction occurring on day 5 (Friday) adds to the risk signal, per the model’s pattern recognition.\n\nNote: Other drivers (e.g., from_bank, hour, payment_currency_us_dollar, etc.) have smaller absolute SHAP contributions and are not included here as “most relevant” per the instruction to omit minor drivers.\n\nConclusion\n- The flag appears driven by a strong ACH-based payment format coupled with a large, possibly round-tripping inflow/outflow amount occurring on a Friday. This pattern could be indicative of a high-risk transfer profile in the data (e.g., potential round-tripping or reconciliation activity) but is not conclusive of illicit activity. Given these drivers, a targeted review is warranted to confirm transaction purpose, verify counterparties, and assess source of funds/sources of transfer. This assessment remains conditional on the provided drivers and their top contributions.",
