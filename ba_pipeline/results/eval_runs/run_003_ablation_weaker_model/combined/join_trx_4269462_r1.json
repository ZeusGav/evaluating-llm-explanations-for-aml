  "llm_text": "Why:\n- Payment format ACH (payment_format_ach=1) has the largest absolute SHAP value (2.9789) with direction increase, making ACH usage the primary driver for the flag.\n- Payment currency Saudi Riyal (payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1) contributes positively (SHAP 0.516) to the risk signal, indicating the payer is using SAR.\n- Receiving currency Saudi Riyal (receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1) also contributes (SHAP 0.271), reinforcing SAR involvement on the receiving side.\n- Amount received (amount_received=49149.3) adds to the risk with SHAP 0.420, representing a sizable inflow in the receiving currency.\n- From bank (from_bank=148016) has a negative SHAP (-0.449), indicating this sending bank identifier reduces the risk contribution somewhat.\n- Payment currency USD (payment_currency_us_dollar=0) shows a positive SHAP (0.260) despite USD not being the payer currency, implying the model sees higher risk when USD is not the payer currency in this context.\n- Hour (14) contributes (SHAP 0.223), and Day of Week (5, Friday) contributes (SHAP 0.185), suggesting time-based pattern signals are present, albeit less impactful than the currency/form factor drivers.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag is mainly driven by the combination of ACH-based payment (payment_format_ach) and SAR-denominated payment and receipt (payment_currency_saudi_riyal and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal) with a sizable amount (amount_received). These factors collectively generate a strong risk signal, while the sending-bank driver reduces risk modestly (from_bank). The absence of USD as payer currency also aligns with elevated risk in this context. Overall, the driver set supports elevated AML concern for this transaction and warrants review. Potential next steps (based solely on these drivers): verify source of funds and counterparties, and assess whether SAR-based transfers are consistent with expected business activity for the payer/recipient.",
