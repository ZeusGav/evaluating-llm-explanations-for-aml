  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The strongest driver is payment_format_ach (value=1, SHAP=3.05408, direction increase), indicating ACH payments are a major contributor to the flag.\n- High-value components also push risk: amount_paid (9880.3, SHAP=0.518, increase) and amount_received (9880.3, SHAP=0.477, increase) both contribute positively to the flag.\n- A moderate opposing signal comes from from_bank (148785, SHAP=-0.356926, decrease), which slightly reduces the risk signal.\n- Additional positive contributors include payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1, SHAP=0.203492, increase), hour (13, SHAP=0.152151, increase), and to_bank (119, SHAP=0.0775059, increase). These collectively add modest support to the risk signal.\n- Other listed drivers with smaller absolute SHAP values (e.g., dayofweek 1, SHAP=0.0620) provide minor incremental input but are less influential.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based on the top drivers, the transaction shows elevated AML risk driven primarily by the ACH payment format and high-value transfer components, with a modest, partially counterbalancing signal from the sending bank. The overall pattern is a net positive risk signal from the strongest drivers, warranting manual review or further verification.",
