  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (ACH payment used) with SHAP_value 3.14549 and direction increase. This is the strongest risk-driving signal among the provided features.\n- to_bank = 20 with SHAP_value 1.06159 and direction increase. Sending to this bank contributes to the elevated risk signal.\n- from_bank = 12 with SHAP_value -1.02009 and direction decrease. This feature reduces risk, but the magnitude is smaller than the ACH and to_bank signals, so it partially offsets the overall risk.\n- amount_received = 14148.0 with SHAP_value 0.905171 and direction increase. The large receiving amount adds to the risk signal.\n- amount_paid = 14148.0 with SHAP_value 0.61475 and direction increase. The exact same amount on the payment side reinforces the model’s concern.\n\nNote: The same value appears for amount_received and amount_paid (14148.0), and both contribute positively to the risk signal.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the top drivers, the flag is driven primarily by the ACH payment format to bank 20, with substantial positive contributions from the large matching amounts received and paid. The signal from from_bank 12 reduces risk but does not negate the ACH-driven concern. Overall, the model indicates elevated risk for this transaction under the provided features; further review or corroborating information is warranted to determine legitimacy.",
