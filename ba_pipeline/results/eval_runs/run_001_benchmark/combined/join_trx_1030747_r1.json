  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — strong positive driver (SHAP +2.951): the ACH payment format was the single largest contributor to increasing the model score.\n- amount_received (value=56984.0) — positive driver (SHAP +0.746): the relatively large received amount increased the score.\n- dayofweek (value=6) — positive driver (SHAP +0.690): occurring on day 6 (Sunday) increased the score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — positive driver (SHAP +0.527): payment currency = Saudi Riyal contributed to increasing the score.\n- from_bank (value=249176) — negative driver (SHAP -0.326): the sending bank ID reduced the model score (partially offsetting the increases above).\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) of a relatively large amount (amount_received=56,984.0) denominated in Saudi Riyals (payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1) that occurred on day 6 (dayofweek=6), with these features collectively driving the score upward. This positive signal was partially offset by the sender bank ID (from_bank=249176) which decreased the score. If further review is required, focus checks on the ACH routing and the context of a SAR-denominated payment of ~56,984 on day 6, noting that the sender bank reduced—rather than increased—the model signal.",
