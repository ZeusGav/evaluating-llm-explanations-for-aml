  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.82994, direction: increase) — the model’s largest positive contributor is that the transaction used ACH as the payment format, which substantially raised the alert score.\n- amount_received = 17462.3 (SHAP +1.28302, direction: increase) — a relatively large received amount further increased the model score.\n- amount_paid = 17462.3 (SHAP +0.61878, direction: increase) — the paid amount (equal to the received amount) also raised the score, though to a lesser degree than the two drivers above.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag was driven primarily by the combination of an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) together with sizable amounts (amount_received and amount_paid ≈ 17,462.3), which collectively raised the model’s risk score. (If one accepts the model’s learned associations, these three features are sufficient to explain the alert; other listed features had much smaller effects and are not required to account for the flag.)",
