  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (feature: payment_format_ach) had the largest positive contribution (SHAP +3.057), so the model flagged the transaction primarily because it is an ACH payment.\n- dayofweek = 6 (feature: dayofweek; 0=Mon..6=Sun) increased the score (SHAP +0.880), indicating the transaction occurred on Sunday, which contributed to the alert.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 (feature: payment_currency_saudi_riyal) increased the score (SHAP +0.792); receiving_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 (feature: receiving_currency_saudi_riyal) also increased the score (SHAP +0.279). Together these currency flags (both payment and receiving in Saudi riyal) meaningfully raised the model risk estimate.\n- Partially offsetting effects: from_bank = 119 (feature: from_bank) decreased the score (SHAP −0.568), and hour = 4 (feature: hour) decreased the score (SHAP −0.553), reducing the overall flagged risk.\n\nConclusion:\n- The alert is driven mainly by the combination of an ACH payment (payment_format_ach = 1), occurrence on Sunday (dayofweek = 6), and both payment and receiving currencies being Saudi riyal (payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal = 1). These factors increased the model score enough to trigger the flag despite lowering contributions from from_bank = 119 and hour = 4.\n- Conditional note: if further triage is needed, prioritize reviewing ACH details and SAR-related payment context (given the named features) since they are the principal drivers of the flag.",
