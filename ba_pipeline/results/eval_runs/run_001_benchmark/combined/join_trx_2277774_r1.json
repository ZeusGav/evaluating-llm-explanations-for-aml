  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) was the dominant driver, increasing the model score by SHAP=+2.76545 — the model raised risk because this is an ACH payment.\n- amount_received (19693.8) increased the score by SHAP=+1.20864 — the relatively large received amount contributed to the flag.\n- amount_paid (19693.8) also increased the score by SHAP=+0.66807 — the paid amount reinforced the effect of the large transaction.\n- dayofweek (6) increased the score by SHAP=+0.60043 — the transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) further raised the score.\n- hour (23) decreased the score by SHAP=-0.51706 — the late hour partially offset the above increases.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) involving a relatively large amount (amount_received and amount_paid = 19,693.8) and occurring on dayofweek=6; these features together raised the risk score, with hour=23 providing a modest downward effect.\n- If investigating, prioritize verification related to the ACH payment and the large, weekend-timed amount (these are the features driving the flag).",
