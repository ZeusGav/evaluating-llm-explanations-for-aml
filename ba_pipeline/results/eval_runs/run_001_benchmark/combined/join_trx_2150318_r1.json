  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (shap 2.98897, direction: increase): the use of ACH was the single largest contributor to the flag.\n- to_bank = 12 (shap 0.77536, direction: increase): the receiving bank identifier (to_bank) increased the model score.\n- amount_paid = 10215.3 (shap 0.655751, direction: increase) and amount_received = 10215.3 (shap 0.479942, direction: increase): the ~10,215.3 payment and identical received amount both increased the score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (shap 0.635047, direction: increase): the transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) increased the score.\n- payment_currency_euro = 1 (shap 0.488963, direction: increase): payment in euros contributed to the higher score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) routed to receiving bank ID 12, for a relatively large amount (amount_paid/amount_received = 10215.3) in euros on dayofweek=6; these features jointly raised the model score. If patterns that raise risk in the model include ACH usage, higher amounts, euro currency, weekend timing, and this specific to_bank value, then this record aligns with those risk-driving characteristics.",
