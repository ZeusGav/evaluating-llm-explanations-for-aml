  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.86083, direction=increase): The use of ACH strongly increased the model score and is the single largest driver of the flag.\n- amount_received (value=18663; SHAP=+0.946637, direction=increase): A relatively large received amount materially increased the score.\n- amount_paid (value=18663; SHAP=+0.732343, direction=increase): The paid amount also increased the score and equals amount_received (18663), reinforcing the magnitude contribution.\n- dayofweek (value=6 (Sunday); SHAP=+0.765607, direction=increase): Occurrence on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) contributed to a higher score.\n- from_bank (value=11296; SHAP=−0.853389, direction=decrease): The sending bank identifier decreased the score, partially offsetting other increases.\n\nConclusion:\n- The transaction was flagged mainly because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) involving a sizable amount (amount_received=18663 and amount_paid=18663) occurring on dayofweek=6 (Sunday); these factors increased the model score substantially, despite a risk-lowering contribution from from_bank=11296.\n- Conditional/hypothesis (hedged): If equal amount_received and amount_paid (both 18663) reflect no net adjustment, this could indicate no conversion or net fee impact on the transfer, which is relevant to review.",
