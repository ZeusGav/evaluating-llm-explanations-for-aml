  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1, SHAP=+2.90662, direction=increase): the model’s top driver — the ACH payment format strongly increased the risk score.\n- amount_received (value=11226.2, SHAP=+0.827961, direction=increase) and amount_paid (value=11226.2, SHAP=+0.711713, direction=increase): both sizable and equal values meaningfully increased the score.\n- dayofweek (value=5, SHAP=+0.432066, direction=increase): the transaction occurred on day 5 (per feature mapping), which contributed to a higher score.\n- from_bank (value=117453, SHAP=-0.554066, direction=decrease): the sending bank ID reduced the score somewhat, partially offsetting the increases above.\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged this transaction primarily because it was an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) combined with relatively large, equal amounts received and paid (amount_received and amount_paid = 11226.2), with timing (dayofweek=5) adding additional upward pressure; the sending bank (from_bank) reduced the score but did not negate the flag. If one accepts these features as material, further review should focus on the ACH nature and the large/equal amounts.",
