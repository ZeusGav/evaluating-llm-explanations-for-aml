  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) was the dominant positive driver (SHAP +2.77623 → increases score); the model flagged the transaction largely because it was an ACH payment.\n- amount_received (17441.1) contributed positively (SHAP +0.96677 → increases score); amount_paid (17441.1) also contributed positively (SHAP +0.44970 → increases score). Both features point to the same sizable amount flowing in and out.\n- to_bank (1467) contributed a further positive effect (SHAP +0.51002 → increases score), indicating the receiving bank ID raised the alert score.\n- hour (22) had a negative contribution (SHAP -0.45552 → decreases score) that partially offset the above increases.\n- from_bank (21611) had a small negative contribution (SHAP -0.18196 → decreases score).\n\nConclusion:\n- The alert is primarily driven by the transaction being an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) combined with matched, relatively large amount values (amount_received=17441.1 and amount_paid=17441.1) and the receiving bank identifier (to_bank=1467). The late hour (hour=22) and the sending bank (from_bank=21611) modestly reduced the model score but did not outweigh the positive drivers.\n- If the model treats ACH payments and these amount/to_bank patterns as higher risk, then the observed SHAP contributions are consistent with that behavior.",
