  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +3.15852, direction: increase): the use of ACH was the single largest positive contributor to the alert score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (SHAP +0.829543, direction: increase): the transaction occurred on dayofweek 6 (Sunday), which increased the score.\n- amount_received = 11349.2 (SHAP +0.702568, direction: increase) and amount_paid = 11349.2 (SHAP +0.468737, direction: increase): the mid five‑figure amount in both payment and receipt added to the alert contribution.\n- to_bank = 11 (SHAP +0.676311, direction: increase): the receiving bank ID 11 increased the score.\n- from_bank = 12 (SHAP −0.909047, direction: decrease): the sending bank ID 12 reduced the overall alert score (partially offsetting the positives above).\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged the transaction mainly because it was an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) of 11,349.2 (amount_paid/amount_received) to bank ID 11 occurring on dayofweek 6 (Sunday); these features contributed positively to the alert. The sending bank (from_bank = 12) reduced the score but did not fully offset the strong positive contributions.",
