  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1): largest positive contributor (SHAP +2.90004, direction=increase). The ACH payment format strongly raised the model score.  \n- amount_paid (value=12389.8): positive contributor (SHAP +0.85718, direction=increase). The payment size increased the score.  \n- amount_received (value=12389.8): positive contributor (SHAP +0.823461, direction=increase). The received amount similarly increased the score.  \n- to_bank (value=20): positive contributor (SHAP +0.511779, direction=increase). The receiving bank ID 20 increased the score.  \n- dayofweek (value=5): positive contributor (SHAP +0.44197, direction=increase). The transaction occurring on day 5 (per 0=Mon..6=Sun) increased the score.  \n- from_bank (value=23344): negative contributor (SHAP −0.633972, direction=decrease). The sending bank ID 23344 reduced the model score somewhat.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag is primarily driven by the use of ACH (payment_format_ach=1) combined with relatively large, equal payment and received amounts (amount_paid and amount_received = 12,389.8) and an effect from the receiving bank (to_bank=20) and timing (dayofweek=5), which together pushed the model score upward. This upward pressure was partially offset by the sending bank (from_bank=23344) lowering the score, but not enough to prevent the flag.",
