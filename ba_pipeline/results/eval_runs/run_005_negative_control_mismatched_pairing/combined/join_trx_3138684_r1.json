  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (payment_format_ach) had the largest positive contribution (SHAP +2.81896), so the model strongly increased the flag score because this is an ACH payment.\n- amount_received = 10066.5 (amount_received) and amount_paid = 10066.5 (amount_paid) both contributed positively (SHAP +1.00155 and +0.76978 respectively); the transaction amount (and the fact that received and paid amounts are the same) increased the model score.\n- from_bank = 218897 (from_bank) and to_bank = 27288 (to_bank) had negative contributions (SHAP −0.27617 and −0.21695), so these specific sending/receiving bank identifiers slightly reduced the flag score but did not outweigh the positive drivers.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag is driven primarily by the ACH payment method (payment_format_ach = 1) together with a notable transaction amount (amount_received and amount_paid = 10066.5), which the model treated as risk-increasing. The sending and receiving bank identifiers (from_bank, to_bank) modestly decreased the risk score but were not sufficient to offset the ACH and amount effects. If one assumes model behavior implied by these features, the item warrants review based on ACH method plus the reported amount.",
