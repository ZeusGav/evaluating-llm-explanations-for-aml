  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 — strong positive driver (SHAP +2.82389): the ACH payment format substantially increased the model score.\n- amount_paid = 7222.58 — positive driver (SHAP +0.810026): the payment size contributed further to increasing the score.\n- dayofweek = 5 (per fact sheet 0=Mon..6=Sun → Saturday) — positive driver (SHAP +0.460643): the transaction occurring on dayofweek 5 increased the score.\n- to_bank = 14290 — negative driver (SHAP −0.320203): the receiving bank ID reduced the model score somewhat.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged mainly because the combination of an ACH payment (payment_format_ach) and a mid‑large amount (amount_paid = 7,222.58), occurring on dayofweek = 5, produced a net increase in the model score; the to_bank feature partially offset that effect but not enough to prevent the flag. (This assessment is based only on the listed driver features.)",
