  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) was the dominant driver — SHAP +2.89419 — i.e., the transaction being an ACH payment substantially increased the model score.\n- amount_received (15710.5) and amount_paid (15710.5) both increased the score (SHAP +0.801179 and +0.770454 respectively), so the magnitude (and the equal paid/received values) materially contributed to the flag.\n- dayofweek (value=5; 0=Mon..6=Sun → Saturday) increased the score (SHAP +0.430062), and hour (value=13) gave a smaller positive contribution (SHAP +0.229559). Together the timing (Saturday at 13:00) modestly raised the score.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) combined with relatively large, equal amount_paid/amount_received (15710.5 each), with additional positive contributions from occurring on dayofweek=5 and at hour=13. \n- If one assumes (conditioned on the model’s weighting) that ACH-format transfers and higher amounts drive alerts, then this combination likely pushed the score above the alert threshold and warrants review.",
