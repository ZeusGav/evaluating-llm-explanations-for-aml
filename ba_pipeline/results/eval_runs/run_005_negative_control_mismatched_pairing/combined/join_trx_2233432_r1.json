  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.98433, direction: increase) — the ACH payment format is the largest single positive contributor to the flag.\n- amount_received = 14011.4 (SHAP +0.99296, direction: increase) and amount_paid = 14011.4 (SHAP +0.694761, direction: increase) — the transaction size (same value for received and paid) materially increased the model score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (Sunday) (SHAP +0.710291, direction: increase) — the transaction occurring on dayofweek 6 contributed to the higher score.\n- These upward contributions were partially offset by from_bank = 111443 (SHAP -0.595078, direction: decrease) and payment_currency_us_dollar = 1 (SHAP -0.179128, direction: decrease).\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach = 1) of notable size (amount_received/amount_paid = 14011.4) occurring on dayofweek = 6, which together produced the largest positive SHAP contributions. This effect was partially reduced by the sending bank identifier (from_bank = 111443) and the payment being in USD (payment_currency_us_dollar = 1). If further review is warranted, focus checks on the ACH nature, the ~14,011.4 amount, and the weekend timing, since those features drove the flag.",
