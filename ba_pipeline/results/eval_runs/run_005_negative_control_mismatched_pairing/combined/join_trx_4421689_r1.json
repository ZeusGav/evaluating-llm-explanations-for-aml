  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +3.02638): the use of ACH was the single largest driver increasing the model score.\n- amount_paid = 12249.7 (SHAP +0.839999): the reported payment amount increased the score.\n- amount_received = 12249.7 (SHAP +0.767354): the reported received amount also increased the score.\n- to_bank = 1490 (SHAP +0.497086): routing to receiving bank ID 1490 contributed to a higher score.\n- payment_currency_euro = 1 (SHAP +0.479738): the payment being in euro increased the score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) combined with matching paid and received amounts of 12,249.7 (amount_paid and amount_received) and routing to bank ID 1490, with the payment currency set to euro (payment_currency_euro=1). These features, taken together, raised the model’s risk score. If further review is needed, verify ACH details and the receiving bank (to_bank=1490) consistent with the transaction record.",
