  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) was the dominant positive driver (SHAP +2.82631) — the ACH payment format materially increased the model score.\n- amount_received (value=13839.8) contributed positively (SHAP +0.872715), indicating the received amount increased the score.\n- to_bank (value=22) contributed positively (SHAP +0.756066), indicating the receiving bank ID increased the score.\n- from_bank (value=1522) contributed negatively (SHAP −0.698028), indicating the sending bank ID reduced the score.\n- amount_paid (value=13839.8) also contributed positively (SHAP +0.693704), reinforcing the effect of the transaction size.\n- dayofweek (value=5) had a smaller positive contribution (SHAP +0.435954), i.e., the transaction’s day increased the score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged the transaction primarily because payment_format_ach = 1 (largest positive SHAP) combined with a relatively large amount (amount_received and amount_paid = 13,839.8) and the receiving bank (to_bank = 22), which together raised the score. The sending bank (from_bank = 1522) partially offset that increase. If higher positive SHAP indicates higher model risk, then, based solely on these drivers, the transaction’s ACH format and amounts are the main reasons it was flagged.",
