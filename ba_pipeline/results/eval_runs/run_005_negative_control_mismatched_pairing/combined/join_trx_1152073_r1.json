  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) had the largest positive contribution (shap_value=+2.90216, direction=increase) — the use of ACH format is the single strongest driver pushing the score up.\n- amount_received (value=15968.2) contributed positively (shap_value=+0.899807, direction=increase); the receiving amount is a material upward driver.\n- amount_paid (value=15968.2) also contributed positively (shap_value=+0.764144, direction=increase); the payment amount reinforces the increase.\n- dayofweek (value=6 — Sunday) contributed positively (shap_value=+0.781602, direction=increase); the transaction occurring on dayofweek=6 increases the score.\n- from_bank (value=908) provided a reducing effect (shap_value=−0.922438, direction=decrease); the sending bank ID partially mitigates the flagged signal.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged the transaction primarily because payment_format_ach=1 combined with relatively large amount_received and amount_paid (both 15968.2) and occurrence on dayofweek=6 produced strong positive contributions. The from_bank (908) contribution partially offsets this, but the top drivers sum to a net positive effect (≈ +4.43 from the five drivers listed), explaining why the transaction was flagged.\n- Conditional note: if ACH format or transactions on dayofweek=6 are treated as higher-risk by the model, then those features are the dominant reasons for the alert (based on the named drivers above).",
