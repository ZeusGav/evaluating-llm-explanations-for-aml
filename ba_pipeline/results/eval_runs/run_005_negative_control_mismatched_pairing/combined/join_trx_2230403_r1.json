  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.88704, direction: increase): the use of ACH is the single strongest contributor to raising the model score.\n- dayofweek (value=6; SHAP=+0.77585, direction: increase): the transaction occurring on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) increased the score.\n- amount_received (value=9736.35; SHAP=+0.74299, direction: increase) and amount_paid (value=9736.35; SHAP=+0.74168, direction: increase): the transaction amounts (both received and paid at 9,736.35) each contributed positively to the score.\n- from_bank (value=15231; SHAP=-0.45403, direction: decrease): the sending bank ID partially reduced the model score (offsetting some of the increase).\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction primarily because payment_format_ach=1 combined with relatively large amounts (amount_received and amount_paid ≈ 9,736.35) and timing on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) raised the score; the from_bank=15231 had a moderating (decreasing) effect but did not fully offset the other drivers.\n- Conditional note (hedged): if ACH transfers of this magnitude occurring on dayofweek=6 are atypical for this customer or portfolio, they may warrant manual review given the drivers above.",
