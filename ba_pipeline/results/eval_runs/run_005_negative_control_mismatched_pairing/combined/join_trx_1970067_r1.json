  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) was the dominant driver — SHAP +2.91916 (direction: increase). The model flagged the transaction largely because it was an ACH payment.\n- amount_received (value=13573.3) contributed a further increase — SHAP +1.15270 (direction: increase). The received amount is a material positive contributor.\n- amount_paid (value=13573.3) also increased the score — SHAP +0.82730 (direction: increase). Note both amount_received and amount_paid equal 13,573.3 and each raised the model score.\n- dayofweek (value=5) added a smaller increase — SHAP +0.41900 (direction: increase). (Per feature definition, dayofweek=5 corresponds to Saturday.)\n- from_bank (value=8623) reduced the score — SHAP −0.39905 (direction: decrease). The sending bank ID as provided lowered the flagged signal.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (value=1) slightly reduced the score — SHAP −0.120997 (direction: decrease). Payment in US dollars was a modest negative contributor.\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged this transaction primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) combined with relatively large payment/receipt amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 13,573.3), with a smaller additional effect from occurring on dayofweek=5 (Saturday). Offsetting factors were the sending bank (from_bank=8623) and payment_currency_us_dollar=1, which modestly lowered the score. If investigation resources are prioritized by primary drivers, focus first on the ACH method and the transaction amounts, given their strong positive SHAP contributions.",
