  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 increased the model score strongly (feature: payment_format_ach; direction: increase; SHAP contribution highest).  \n- amount_received = 14737.5 (feature: amount_received; direction: increase) and amount_paid = 14737.5 (feature: amount_paid; direction: increase) both contributed positively to the flag — the transaction amounts are a primary risk driver.  \n- dayofweek = 5 (feature: dayofweek; direction: increase; per fact sheet 0=Mon..6=Sun → Saturday) also increased the score.  \n- Partially offsetting these increases were feature contributions from the sending and receiving banks: from_bank = 15 (feature: from_bank; direction: decrease) and to_bank = 14099 (feature: to_bank; direction: decrease), which reduced the overall risk score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) with relatively large, equal paid/received amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 14737.5), occurring on dayofweek=5 (Saturday) — these features raised the model score. However, the specific from_bank and to_bank feature values (from_bank=15 and to_bank=14099) reduced the score somewhat. If further review is required, focus first on verifying the ACH payment details and the context for the amounts given the Saturday timing.",
