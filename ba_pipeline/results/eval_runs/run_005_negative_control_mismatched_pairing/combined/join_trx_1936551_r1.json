  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP +2.8596, direction=increase): the use of ACH is the single largest contributor raising the model score.\n- amount_received (value=17065.8; SHAP +0.921956, direction=increase): the receiving amount contributed noticeably to increasing the score.\n- amount_paid (value=17065.8; SHAP +0.873791, direction=increase): the payment amount similarly increased the score (note: amount_paid equals amount_received).\n- dayofweek (value=6 → Sunday; SHAP +0.670465, direction=increase): the transaction occurring on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) increased the score.\n- from_bank (value=24963; SHAP −0.53296, direction=decrease): the sending bank ID reduced the model score somewhat, partially offsetting other increases.\n\nConclusion:\n- The transaction was flagged primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) combined with matching amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 17065.8) processed on dayofweek=6 (Sunday), which together raised the model score; this elevation was partially offset by the from_bank feature (ID 24963) lowering the score.\n- Conditional/hedged note: if an ACH transfer with these exact amount values and Sunday timing is present, the model is more likely to flag it (given the cited feature contributions).",
