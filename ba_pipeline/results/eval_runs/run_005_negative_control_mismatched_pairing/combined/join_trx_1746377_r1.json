  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (feature: payment_format_ach) was the dominant positive driver (SHAP +2.9112), i.e., the use of ACH substantially increased the model score.\n- amount_paid = 7052.99 (feature: amount_paid) was the next-largest positive contributor (SHAP +1.1174), so the transaction amount further increased the score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (feature: dayofweek) contributed positively (SHAP +0.891227), indicating the transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) raised the score.\n- from_bank = 23842 (feature: from_bank) had a negative contribution (SHAP −0.391379), meaning the sending bank ID modestly reduced the model score (a mitigating factor).\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach) of $7,052.99 (amount_paid) executed on dayofweek = 6 (Sunday), which together materially increased the model’s risk score; the sending bank (from_bank = 23842) slightly offset that increase. If further review is desired, focus on verifying the ACH payment details and the context of a weekend (dayofweek = 6) ACH for this amount, since those features drove the alert.",
