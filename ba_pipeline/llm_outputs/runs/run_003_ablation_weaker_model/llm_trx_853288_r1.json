  "llm_text": "Why:\n\n- The top risk driver is payment_format_ach (value=1) with SHAP value 3.03902 and direction increase, indicating the use of an ACH payment format strongly pushes the model toward flagging.\n\n- The next largest contributor is from_bank (value=12) with SHAP value -1.11777 and direction decrease, meaning the sending bank slightly reduces the risk signal, but not enough to offset the ACH-driven risk.\n\n- Large, matching monetary amounts contribute via amount_received (16093.5; SHAP 0.928357, increase) and amount_paid (16093.5; SHAP 0.627656, increase), both elevating risk due to substantial transfers.\n\n- to_bank (value=23; SHAP 0.697119, increase) also contributes to the risk signal, suggesting a noteworthy recipient bank profile.\n\n- dayofweek (value=5; SHAP 0.423307, increase) adds to risk, indicating the transaction occurred on a weekend-day pattern associated with higher risk signals in the model.\n\n- (Note: Smaller drivers such as receiving_currency_euro, payment_format_credit_card, payment_format_cheque, and payment_currency_euro exist but are minor here; the strongest signals are the ACH method, large transfer amounts, and the recipient/timing factors listed above.)\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Based on the provided drivers, the flag is primarily driven by ACH payment usage and the large, equal transfer amounts to a specific recipient bank, with an added weekend-day timing signal. The sending bank feature slightly mitigates risk, but not enough to negate the ACH-driven signal. Overall, the pattern suggests elevated risk requiring further review, subject to corroborating customer context and KYC information."
