  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach: value=1; shap_value=2.98813; direction=increase. Explanation: Use of ACH as the payment method strongly contributes to the flag, indicating a high-risk payment channel per the driver.\n- amount_received: value=14108.6; shap_value=0.87731; direction=increase. Explanation: A substantial amount received increases the risk signal.\n- dayofweek: value=6; shap_value=0.771768; direction=increase. Explanation: Transaction occurred on Sunday, which contributes to risk signaling.\n- amount_paid: value=14108.6; shap_value=0.758791; direction=increase. Explanation: A large amount paid aligns with the elevated risk signal.\n- from_bank: value=22828; shap_value=-0.715358; direction=decrease. Explanation: Large sending-bank value reduces the risk signal somewhat, but the positive contributions from the other top drivers dominate the overall flag.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the top drivers, the flag is driven primarily by ACH usage with a substantial inbound and outbound amount and by processing on a Sunday, with a mitigating signal from the sending bank. The overall pattern suggests elevated risk warranting further review, though the from_bank factor slightly tempers the signal."
