  "llm_text": "Why (core explanation grounded in the drivers and directions)\n- payment_format_ach = 1 with SHAP_value = 3.03318 (increase): This is the strongest contributor and indicates the use of ACH as the payment method is a primary driver pushing the flag.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 with SHAP_value = 0.571676 (increase): The transaction is conducted in Saudi Riyal, which adds risk signal alongside the ACH format.\n- amount_received = 30072.8 with SHAP_value = 0.322905 (increase): A relatively large amount received increases the risk signal in combination with the above factors.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 with SHAP_value = 0.257559 (increase): Receiving in Saudi Riyal reinforces the currency pattern contributing to the flag.\n- from_bank = 48308 with SHAP_value = -0.416701 (decrease): This factor reduces the risk signal, meaning the sending bank slightly offsets the overall driver pattern; it does not negate the other stronger drivers but lessens the net push from this angle.\n\nConclusion\n- Based on the top drivers, the flag is primarily driven by the ACH payment format and Saudi Riyal currency indicators, accompanied by a sizable amount received. The from_bank factor moderates the signal somewhat. Overall, the current driver combination suggests a notable risk signal from ACH + currency pattern plus amount, warranting targeted review of counterparty details, purpose of the ACH transfer, and currency considerations. If these drivers align with typical customer behavior, the tag may reflect routine activity; otherwise, proceed with standard AML escalation and corroborating source-of-funds checks."
