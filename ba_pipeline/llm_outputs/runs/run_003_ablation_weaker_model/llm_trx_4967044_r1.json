  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach: The transaction uses ACH (payment_format_ach = 1) and carries the largest SHAP contribution (+2.6974) among the drivers, indicating ACH payments strongly increase the flag risk in this case.\n- amount_received: The received amount is 17945.7 with SHAP +1.09529, meaning a relatively large inbound amount contributes meaningfully to the flag signal.\n- amount_paid: The paid amount is 17945.7 with SHAP +0.486472, reinforcing that a large, matching payout amount also increases the flag signal.\n- dayofweek: dayofweek = 5 (Saturday) with SHAP +0.470036, suggesting the transaction occurring on a weekend day adds to the model’s suspicion.\n- to_bank: to_bank = 21940 with SHAP +0.259539, indicating the transfer to the specified receiving bank further increases the likelihood of flagging.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the top drivers, the transaction shows elevated AML risk driven primarily by the ACH payment format and large, matched received/paid amounts, with a weekend timing and a transfer to the specified bank contributing additional risk. While some negative signals (e.g., from_bank) and other smaller positive signals exist, the dominant SHAP contributions point toward a flagged pattern warranting escalation for review."
