  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1, shap_value=2.98433, direction=increase): The ACH payment format strongly contributes to the risk signal, indicating the transaction uses ACH as the payment method, which the model associates with higher risk in this case.\n- amount_received (14011.4, shap_value=0.99296, direction=increase): A relatively large receipt amount increases the model’s risk score, marking this as a noteworthy value in the receiving side.\n- dayofweek (6, shap_value=0.710291, direction=increase): Processing on Sunday (day 6) adds to the risk signal, suggesting weekend timing contributes to the flag.\n- amount_paid (14011.4, shap_value=0.694761, direction=increase): The same substantial amount on the payment side reinforces the elevated risk tied to the transaction’s size.\n- from_bank (111443, shap_value=-0.595078, direction=decrease): This sending bank contributes to reducing the risk signal, acting as a mitigating factor within the overall drivers.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the top drivers, the transaction is flagged primarily due to the ACH payment format and the notably large amounts (both received and paid) processed on a Sunday, with a mitigating note from the sending bank. While the from_bank factor lowers risk somewhat, the dominant signals from payment_format_ach, amount_received, dayofweek, and amount_paid indicate elevated AML concern requiring review."
