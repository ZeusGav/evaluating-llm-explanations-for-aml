  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) has the largest positive impact (SHAP=2.91302, direction increase), strongly indicating the use of an ACH payment format contributes to the flag.\n- amount_paid (12682.5) has a positive contribution (SHAP=0.843975, direction increase) as does amount_received (12682.5) with SHAP=0.782655 (direction increase). These sizable, equal payment/receiving amounts raise the risk signal.\n- to_bank (12) adds a positive contribution (SHAP=0.688904, direction increase), indicating transfer to a different bank is part of the risk pattern.\n- from_bank (11157) has a negative contribution (SHAP=-1.00545, direction decrease), i.e., this sending bank feature reduces risk relative to baseline; however, the strong positive signals from ACH and the amounts dominate, keeping the overall risk signal elevated.\n\nConclusion:\n- The transaction is flagged primarily due to the ACH payment format combined with large, equal payment/receiving amounts and a transfer to another bank. The negative contribution from from_bank slightly mitigates risk but does not negate the overall elevated risk indicated by the top drivers (payment_format_ach, amount_paid, amount_received, to_bank)."
