  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach increases risk with SHAP value 2.82653 (value=1), indicating ACH as the payment method is a strong contributor to the flag.\n- amount_received increases risk (SHAP value 1.19866; value=16655.7), suggesting the relatively large receipt in the transaction raises concern.\n- to_bank increases risk (SHAP value 0.867398; value=20), implicating the receiving bank ID as a contributing factor.\n- dayofweek increases risk (SHAP value 0.834764; value=6), meaning the transaction occurring on Sunday adds to the risk signal.\n- hour decreases risk (SHAP value -0.791869; value=0), indicating the hour (0) reduces the risk signal.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the top drivers, the transaction shows an elevated risk signal driven by ACH payment format, a relatively large amount received, and the receiving bank and day of week contributing to the flag. The hour factor partially mitigates the signal. Overall, the driver pattern supports a flagged assessment and warrants further review utilising additional context."
