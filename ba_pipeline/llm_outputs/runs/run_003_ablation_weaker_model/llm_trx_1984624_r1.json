  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1, shap_value=2.94586, direction an increase): The use of ACH is the strongest driver increasing the flag signal.\n- amount_received (19753.5, shap_value=0.806184, direction increase): A relatively large received amount contributes to the risk signal.\n- dayofweek (6, shap_value=0.68572, direction increase): Transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) adds to the flag probability.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (1, shap_value=0.458878, direction increase): Use of Saudi Riyal as the payment currency increases the risk signal.\n- amount_paid (19753.5, shap_value=0.359093, direction increase): The corresponding large amount paid reinforces the flag.\n- from_bank (118, shap_value=-0.451851, direction decrease): This sending bank factor reduces the risk signal, partially offsetting the overall trigger.\n\nConclusion:\n- The flag is driven primarily by the ACH payment format, the large amount received/paid, and Sunday timing, with SAR currency contributing to the elevated signal. The from_bank factor slightly mitigates the risk. Overall, the provided drivers collectively support a higher-risk assessment for this transaction based on the stated attributes. If additional context shows this aligns with known customer behavior or legitimate operation, the assessment may be revisited; otherwise, the top drivers suggest continued scrutiny."
