  "llm_text": "Why\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; shap_value=2.94866; direction=increase): The ACH payment format is the strongest driver increasing the flag, indicating the transaction used ACH as the payment method.\n- amount_paid (13218.8; shap_value=0.852751; direction=increase): A large amount paid contributes to the risk signal.\n- amount_received (13218.8; shap_value=0.830426; direction=increase): The same large amount received adds to the risk signal, reinforcing a high-value transfer pattern.\n- from_bank (4259; shap_value=-0.767747; direction=decrease): This sending-bank factor reduces risk, partially mitigating the overall signal.\n- to_bank (20; shap_value=0.704146; direction=increase): The receiving-bank indicator (despite a low numeric value) increases risk, adding to the overall concern.\n\nConclusion\n- The flag is driven primarily by the ACH payment format and the large, equal paid/received amounts, with the sending-bank factor reducing risk and the receiving-bank factor increasing risk. Based on these drivers alone, the transaction exhibits a high-risk pattern that warrants manual review to determine legitimate purpose."
