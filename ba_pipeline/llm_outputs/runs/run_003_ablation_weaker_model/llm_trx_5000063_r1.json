  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The strongest driver is payment_format_ach (value=1) with SHAP_value 2.87783 and direction increase, indicating the transaction uses ACH and that this payment format markedly raises the model’s risk signal.\n- The next two strongest drivers are amount_received (14,365.3) with SHAP_value 0.841689 and amount_paid (14,365.3) with SHAP_value 0.78725, both direction increase. The large, equal amounts on both the receiving and paying sides contribute to an elevated risk signal.\n- Additional supportive signals include to_bank (value=12) with SHAP_value 0.491518 and dayofweek (value=5) with SHAP_value 0.430737, both increasing risk, and hour (14) with SHAP_value 0.177254, which modestly reinforces the signal.\n- There are mitigating signals in the set: from_bank (value=22758) with SHAP_value -0.643526 and receiving_currency_euro (value=1) with SHAP_value -0.387658, both decreasing risk. These reduce risk somewhat but do not overturn the dominant positive contributions from ACH and the large transfers.\n- Minor drivers (e.g., payment_format_credit_card, payment_format_cash) contribute small positives but are less influential than the top drivers.\n\nConclusion:\n- The configuration shows an elevated risk signal driven by an ACH payment format combined with substantial, equal amount movement on both sides, and corroborating timing signals (to_bank, dayofweek, hour). While there are some mitigating signals (from_bank and euro-receiving), the net effect from the most impactful drivers supports the flagged status and warrants focused review of counterparties, payment routing, and the involved banks. However, based solely on the provided drivers, this does not definitively establish illicit activity and should be evaluated with additional context."
