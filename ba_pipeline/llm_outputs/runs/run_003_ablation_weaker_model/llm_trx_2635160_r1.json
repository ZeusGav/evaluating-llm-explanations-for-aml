  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) with SHAP=2.81086 and direction increase: this ACH-based payment format is the strongest driver pushing the transaction toward a flag.\n- amount_paid (9226.42) with SHAP=0.808249 and direction increase: a relatively high payment amount contributing to risk.\n- amount_received (9226.42) with SHAP=0.722327 and direction increase: a high receipt amount reinforcing the risk signal.\n- from_bank (233580) with SHAP=0.259003 and direction increase: a large sending-bank value adding to the risk signal.\n- hour (17) with SHAP=0.225023 and direction increase: activity at 5 PM contributes to the model’s concern.\n- dayofweek (0) with SHAP=0.136658 and direction increase: Monday timing adds incremental risk signal.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (1) with SHAP=-0.149836 and direction decrease: presence of USD reduces risk slightly, offsetting part of the ACH and amount signals.\n(Notes: minor drivers like to_bank=3420 with SHAP=0.12175 and credit card/cheque indicators have smaller contributions and are not emphasized here.)\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction is flagged primarily due to the ACH payment format combined with high and matching amounts (amount_paid and amount_received) and the involvement of a large sending bank, with additional time-of-day and day-of-week signals. The USD currency presence slightly mitigates risk, but the dominant ACH/amount signals keep the overall assessment elevated. A focused manual review to verify counterparties, source of funds, and legitimacy of the ACH transfer is advisable, conditional on no additional corroborating information."
