  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach increases the risk signal (feature: payment_format_ach with SHAP value 2.83419, direction: increase). This indicates the transaction uses ACH as the payment method, which is driving the primary risk indicator.\n- amount_received increases the risk signal (feature: amount_received, value: 13014.3, SHAP 1.0451, direction: increase) and amount_paid also increases risk (feature: amount_paid, value: 13014.3, SHAP 0.648652, direction: increase). The same amount appearing on both sides suggests a large, symmetrical transfer, contributing to the elevated signal.\n- from_bank increases risk (feature: from_bank, value: 214322, SHAP 0.365421, direction: increase), indicating the sending bank is contributing to the risk signal.\n- to_bank decreases risk (feature: to_bank, value: 10404, SHAP -0.273788, direction: decrease) and hour decreases risk (feature: hour, value: 7, SHAP -0.254602, direction: decrease). These factors modestly mitigate the overall risk signal, with the receiving bank and the 7:00 hour contributing to a lower-than-peak baseline.\n- Among the top drivers, the ACH payment format is the strongest contributor, followed by the large, symmetrical transfer amounts and the sending-bank factor; the receiving-bank and hour-related factors provide some mitigation.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based solely on the provided driver features, the transaction exhibits an elevated AML risk signal driven chiefly by the ACH payment format and large, symmetrical transfer amounts, with the sending bank contributing to the risk and the receiving bank/hour providing some mitigation. This pattern warrants a manual review to confirm alignment with known risk indicators and counterparties."
