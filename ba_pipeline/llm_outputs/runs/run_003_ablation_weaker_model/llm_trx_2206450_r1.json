  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The highest-contributing drivers (by absolute SHAP) are:\n  - payment_format_ach (value 1; SHAP 2.74305; direction increase): the transaction uses ACH as the payment method, which the model associates with higher risk.\n  - to_bank (value 20; SHAP 0.959191; direction increase): the receiving bank indicator adds risk signal.\n  - amount_paid (3501.5; SHAP 0.77653; direction increase): a relatively large paid amount adds to risk.\n  - dayofweek (6; SHAP 0.739734; direction increase): occurring on day 6 (weekend) increases risk signal.\n- A single negative contributor slightly mitigating the risk:\n  - amount_received (3501.5; SHAP -0.575362; direction decrease): the received amount reduces risk, but its impact is smaller than the positive drivers above.\n- Minor contributors (for context only): hour, payment_format_credit_card, payment_format_cash, and from_bank provide smaller positive or negative nudges.\n- Synthesis: The flag is primarily driven by the ACH payment method, a specific to_bank indicator, and a relatively large payment amount occurring on a weekend, all of which push the model toward a higher risk score. The negative contribution from amount_received slightly reduces risk but does not overturn the stronger positive drivers.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based on the named drivers, the transaction demonstrates a strong risk signal driven by payment_format_ach, to_bank, amount_paid, and dayofweek, with a modest counterbalance from amount_received. This pattern supports a flagged assessment under the given drivers; however, without external context on the receiving bank or customer profile, this rationale remains driven solely by the provided driver features and should be followed by standard manual review and corroboration with additional data if available."
