  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) has a SHAP_value of 2.77623 with direction \"increase\": use of ACH payment format strongly increases the risk signal, making it the primary driver for the flag.\n- amount_received (value=17441.1) has a SHAP_value of 0.966773 with direction \"increase\": the notable receiving amount adds to the risk signal.\n- to_bank (value=1467) has a SHAP_value of 0.510018 with direction \"increase\": sending to this receiving bank contributes to the flag.\n- hour (value=22) has a SHAP_value of -0.455518 with direction \"decrease\": the late hour reduces the risk signal, acting as a mitigating factor.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag appears primarily driven by the ACH payment format, the substantial amount received, and the receiving bank, with a modest mitigating effect from the late-hour timing. Based on these drivers alone, the transaction would warrant review as a potential AML concern, while the late-hour signal slightly reduces the overall risk impression."
