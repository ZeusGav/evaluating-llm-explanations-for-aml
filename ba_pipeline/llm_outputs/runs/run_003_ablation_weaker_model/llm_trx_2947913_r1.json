  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach: The transaction uses ACH (payment_format_ach = 1) and this feature shows a high positive SHAP contribution (shap_value = 2.91424) driving the flag (direction: increase).\n- amount_received: The receiving amount is 13431.6 (amount_received), with a notable positive SHAP contribution (shap_value = 1.06366) indicating increased risk (direction: increase).\n- amount_paid: The amount paid is 13431.6 (amount_paid), with a positive SHAP contribution (shap_value = 0.716867) toward the flag (direction: increase).\n- from_bank: Sending from_bank = 214621 contributes positively to the flag (shap_value = 0.569508) (direction: increase).\n- to_bank: Receiving bank (to_bank = 1547) also contributes positively (shap_value = 0.309093) toward the flag (direction: increase).\n\nConclusion:\nBased solely on the named drivers, the model indicates a high-risk signal driven by ACH payment method, a relatively large and exact-match transfer amount (amount_received and amount_paid both 13431.6), and the identified sending/receiving banks. This combination supports an elevated risk assessment and would warrant escalation to a manual review for further investigation."
