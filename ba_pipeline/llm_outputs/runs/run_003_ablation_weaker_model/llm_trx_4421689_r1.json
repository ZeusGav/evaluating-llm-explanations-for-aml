  "llm_text": "Why\n- The strongest contributor is payment_format_ach (value=1) with SHAP=3.02638, direction: increase. This indicates the ACH payment format is a primary factor driving the flag.\n- Large positive contributions from amount_paid (12249.7, SHAP=0.84) and amount_received (12249.7, SHAP=0.767). The notable transfer size in both the payer and recipient sides is contributing to the risk signal.\n- to_bank (value=1490, SHAP=0.497, direction increase) adds to the risk signal by indicating a specific receiving bank is involved.\n- payment_currency_euro is active (value=1, SHAP=0.4797, direction increase), meaning the transaction is euro-denominated while the primary payment format is ACH. This currency pattern is a notable driver in this flag.\n- Other currency-related drivers with smaller SHAP values (e.g., payment_currency_us_dollar=0, SHAP=0.381797; receiving_currency_us_dollar=0, SHAP=0.163172) are present but contribute less to the overall risk signal.\n- The hour driver has a negative SHAP (-0.227493), suggesting the time of day slightly reduces risk, but this effect is smaller than the top drivers and does not negate the primary risk signal.\n\nConclusion\n- Based on the provided drivers, the transaction is flagged primarily due to the ACH payment format combined with a euro-denominated transfer of a substantial amount to a specific bank, which together contribute the strongest risk signal. The relative symmetry in amount_paid and amount_received reinforces the model’s concern, with the euro currency indicator strengthening the driver set. The time of day slightly mitigates risk, but not sufficiently to overturn the overall signal.\n- Therefore, this transaction warrants manual review for AML purposes to verify legitimate origin and destination, assess the counterparties and beneficiary details, and confirm the business justification for euro-denominated ACH activity."
