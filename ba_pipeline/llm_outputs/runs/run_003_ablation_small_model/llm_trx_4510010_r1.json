  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Overall, multiple factors reduce the suspicion (e.g., ACH, cheque, bank, and amount signals), while the use of US dollars provides a small raising signal. Net effect: a very low suspiciousness score.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (lowers suspicion) because ACH usage here could reflect standard payment activity.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion) sending bank ID aligns with expected counterparties, reducing anomaly.\n- payment_format_cheque (lowers suspicion) cheque payments can be part of normal workflows, lowering concern.\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion) the amount paid may be consistent with normal settlement levels.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (raises suspicion) use of US dollars can indicate cross-border or unusual currency patterns.\ninvestigation_context: If USD-denominated payments are indeed present, this could contribute to the small raise in suspicion observed."
