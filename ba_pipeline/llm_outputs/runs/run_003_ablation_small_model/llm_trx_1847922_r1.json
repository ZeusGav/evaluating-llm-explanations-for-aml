  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The listed factors collectively lower the suspiciousness, given common payment formats (ACH and credit card), standard banks, euro-denominated payments, and typical timing. There are no factors listed that raise suspicion.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (lowers suspicion): The use of ACH as the payment format could be consistent with routine vendor payments.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): from_bank=1490 may reflect standard remittance routing from a known bank.\n- payment_format_credit_card (lowers suspicion): payment_format_credit_card=1 could indicate normal consumer or merchant transactions.\n- amount_received (lowers suspicion): amount_received=863.89 could reflect a common transaction value for everyday payments.\n- hour (lowers suspicion): hour=23 might align with business activity depending on the client profile.\ninvestigation_context: This pattern could be consistent with routine client activity and non-suspicious payments, depending on the client's normal behavior."
