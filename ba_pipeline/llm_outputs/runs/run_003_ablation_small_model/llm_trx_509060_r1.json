  "llm_text": "short_explanation: All listed factors decrease suspicion, notably payment_format_ach, payment_format_cash, and from_bank indicators. Because there are no factors that raise suspicion in this set, the resulting score aligns with a low-suspicion determination.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (lowers suspicion) could be consistent with routine electronic settlement flows.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion) may reflect a standard sending bank used in ordinary transactions.\n- amount_received (lowers suspicion) the amount received could reflect typical transaction values.\n- payment_format_cash (lowers suspicion) presence of cash payment indicator may reflect ordinary cash movements.\n- hour (lowers suspicion) hour 5 could reflect off-hours batch processing.\ninvestigation_context: If these factors continue to be the primary evidence, the low-suspicion assessment remains consistent."
