However, the sending bank and US dollar currency dampen the signal somewhat.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion) The use of ACH could indicate higher risk transfers in this context.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) The large amount received could reflect unusual activity requiring review.\n- dayofweek (raises suspicion) A transaction on Sunday could suggest non-standard timing for transfers.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion) The sending bank may align with routine activity, reducing concerns in this case.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (lowers suspicion) Use of US dollars may reduce suspicion if USD is common for this channel.\ninvestigation_context: If these factors apply as described, they could explain the elevated suspiciousness score."
