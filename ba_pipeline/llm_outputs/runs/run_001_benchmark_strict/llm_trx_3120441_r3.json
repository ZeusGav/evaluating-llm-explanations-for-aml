Smaller increasing signals from the transaction amount and the absence of credit card use modestly raise concern but do not outweigh the lowering factors.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion): non\u2011ACH payment could be consistent with lower\u2011risk settlement methods for this corridor.\n- payment_currency_yen=1 (lowers suspicion): denomination in yen may indicate routine domestic or currency\u2011matched activity.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion): cheque payment could reflect conventional invoicing patterns rather than atypical channels.\n- amount_received=17788.2 (raises suspicion): a notable received amount may warrant contextual review if atypical for the customer.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion): absence of credit card usage in this case slightly increases scrutiny as a differing payment characteristic.\ninvestigation_context: If the currency, payment formats, and bank IDs align with the customer's normal profile, these features may reflect routine business activity rather than illicit behavior."
