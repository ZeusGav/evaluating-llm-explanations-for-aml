  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The low suspiciousness score is driven mainly by several lowering indicators \u2014 payment and receiving currencies in shekel, cheque format, an early-hour timestamp, and the recorded received amount \u2014 which outweigh the raising signals. Two factors, the originating bank (from_bank) and the payment amount (amount_paid), increase attention but do not dominate the overall signal.\n\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank (raises suspicion): the sending bank identifier could, in context, warrant closer attention if that institution is associated with higher risk.\n- amount_paid (raises suspicion): the payment amount may indicate a level of funds that could raise scrutiny depending on the customer profile.\n- payment_format_ach (lowers suspicion): absence of ACH (electronic transfer) could be consistent with non-automated settlement and reduce typical electronic-transfer concerns.\n- receiving_currency_shekel (lowers suspicion): receiving in shekel may align with expected local currency use and lower cross-currency complexity.\n- payment_format_cheque (lowers suspicion): cheque payment format could suggest traditional settlement methods and reduce indicators tied to instant electronic movement.\n\ninvestigation_context: If examined further, the mix of a notable sending bank and payment amount against multiple lowering currency and format indicators might reflect routine domestic settlement rather than clear illicit activity."
