  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness score reflects multiple attributes that raise concern\u2014particularly an ACH payment format and a sizable payment amount\u2014while some banking and currency indicators lower concern. Specifically, the ACH format and large transferred amount raise suspicion, while the sending bank identifier and receipt in euros lower it.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion): ACH as the payment method could be consistent with direct bank-to-bank transfers that may move funds quickly.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): a relatively large received amount could indicate higher-value activity that may warrant attention.\n- to_bank (raises suspicion): the receiving bank identifier could reflect concentration toward a specific recipient bank, which might be notable.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): the sending bank identifier lowers concern, which could reflect expected routing from that sender.\n- receiving_currency_euro (lowers suspicion): receipt in euros lowers concern, which may indicate a standard currency corridor for this transaction.\n\ninvestigation_context: If confirmed, this pattern could be consistent with higher-value ACH transfers between the identified banks."
