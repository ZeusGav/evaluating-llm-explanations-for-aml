At the same time, the sending bank identifier and payment in US dollars lower the score somewhat, which may indicate aspects of the transaction are within expected banking or currency patterns.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion): Use of ACH could be consistent with automated account-to-account transfers that may warrant scrutiny.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): A received amount of 14606 could indicate a high-value transaction that may be atypical for ordinary retail activity.\n- amount_paid (raises suspicion): An identical paid amount of 14606 could be consistent with passthrough or mirrored transfers between accounts.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): The sending bank ID 12 lowers concern, which may reflect a known or routine counterparty in this context.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (lowers suspicion): Payment in US dollars lowers concern, which may suggest standard currency usage between the parties.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these factors accurately represent the activity, they could be consistent with automated high-value transfers or passthrough patterns that merit contextual consideration."
