  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Most observed attributes point to very low concern \u2014 non\u2011ACH format, a cash payment, rupee currency, a late hour, and the recorded payment size all lower suspicion, while the absence of a US dollar payment produces a small opposing signal. Overall, the lowering factors outweigh the single increasing factor, resulting in a near\u2011zero suspiciousness score.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion): absence of ACH could be consistent with alternative local payment routes and reduce immediate concern.\n- payment_format_cash=1 (lowers suspicion): a cash payment could be consistent with routine local cash activity and lower this alert.\n- hour=22 (lowers suspicion): transaction occurring at 22:00 may reflect non-business timing that, in context, lowers the flagged risk here.\n- amount_paid=99228 (lowers suspicion): the recorded payment amount does not by itself raise the score and may align with expected transaction levels.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion): lack of USD payment might indicate non\u2011USD activity that slightly increases scrutiny.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these stated features are accurate, the pattern could be consistent with routine local, non\u2011USD cash activity and therefore appear low risk, though the non\u2011USD signal may modestly raise attention."
