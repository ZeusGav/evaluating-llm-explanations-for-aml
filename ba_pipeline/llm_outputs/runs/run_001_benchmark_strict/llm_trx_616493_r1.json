Overall the factors that lower suspicion outweigh those that raise it, so the transaction registers as low suspiciousness though the receiving bank link and timing could be contextually relevant.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=7478 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with a familiar or routine sending bank that reduces concern.\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 absence of an ACH route could indicate a non-automated payment flow that lessens automated-transfer risk.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 payment by cheque could reflect an offline or conventional method associated with lower transfer velocity.\n- to_bank=1420 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank identifier could point to a counterparty relationship that merits contextual attention.\n- hour=9 (raises suspicion) \u2014 a 9am timestamp could align with business-hour activity but might also reflect timing patterns relevant to investigations.\ninvestigation_context: If reviewed in context, the combination of conventional payment method and small amounts could be consistent with routine business activity while the specific receiving bank and morning hour might warrant further contextual review."
