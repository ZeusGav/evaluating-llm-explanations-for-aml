  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The very low suspiciousness score arises because all top-listed factors lower suspicion \u2014 for example, a modest credit-card payment in Australian dollars between known sending and receiving banks during evening hours. No listed factor increases suspicion, so the combination of payment method, amount, currency, timing and bank identifiers results in a minimal risk signal. \nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=15 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 known sending bank ID could be consistent with an expected counterparty.\n- payment_format_credit_card=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 use of a credit card may indicate consumer-style or routine payment flow.\n- hour=19 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 evening timing could align with ordinary business or personal activity.\n- amount_paid=173.9 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 modest transaction amount may be consistent with routine payments.\n- receiving_currency_australian_dollar=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 payment in AUD may reflect normal local-currency activity.\ninvestigation_context: If further review is considered, these characteristics may be consistent with a routine credit-card-funded payment in Australian dollars rather than an obvious indicator of illicit activity."
