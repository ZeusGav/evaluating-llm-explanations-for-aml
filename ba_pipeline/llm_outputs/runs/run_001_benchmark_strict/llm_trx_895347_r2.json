  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The suspiciousness score is very low because several features\u2014use of a credit card, absence of ACH, identified sending/receiving banks, Swiss franc currency, and a moderate received amount\u2014lower concern. However, the payment amount (amount_paid=5011.57) modestly raises suspicion as higher-value payments could, in some contexts, merit attention.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_credit_card=1 (lowers suspicion): use of a credit card could be consistent with routine consumer payments. \n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion): absence of an ACH method may indicate a non-bank-transfer channel that often aligns with typical card flows.\n- from_bank=238190 (lowers suspicion): a specific sending bank ID may reflect a known banking origin and therefore lower immediate concern.\n- receiving_currency_swiss_franc=1 (lowers suspicion): payment denominated in Swiss francs could be consistent with ordinary cross-border or domestic activity in that currency.\n- amount_paid=5011.57 (raises suspicion): the payment size could, depending on customer profile, warrant closer contextual review.\ninvestigation_context: If additional context is sought, the single raising factor (amount_paid) might indicate a payment magnitude to consider against the customer's normal behavior."
