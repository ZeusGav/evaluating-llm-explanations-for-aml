  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is very low because multiple attributes lower suspicion (same sending and receiving bank, small payment amount, reinvestment method, overnight timing and US dollar currency). A single factor\u2014the amount received\u2014raises a small concern that could reflect passthrough or circular movement in some contexts. \nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=3698 (lowers suspicion): identical sending bank ID could be consistent with internal or familiar counterparty activity.\n- to_bank=3698 (lowers suspicion): identical receiving bank ID could be consistent with intra-bank movement rather than external risk.\n- amount_paid=12.62 (lowers suspicion): a small payment amount could be consistent with routine low\u2011value transactions.\n- payment_format_reinvestment=1 (lowers suspicion): use of reinvestment as the payment method could be consistent with regular account activity.\n- amount_received=12.62 (raises suspicion): the received amount being present and matching the paid amount could be consistent with passthrough or circular flows in some scenarios.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes appear alongside other unusual indicators, they might be consistent with passthrough flows or routine internal/investment processing."
