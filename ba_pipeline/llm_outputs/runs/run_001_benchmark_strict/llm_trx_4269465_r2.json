  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The very high suspiciousness score is driven by multiple payment attributes that raise concern \u2014 notably ACH use, a large transmitted amount, payments in Saudi riyal, and a Sunday transaction timing. One factor, the identified sending bank ID, modestly lowers the score but does not offset the combined increases.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion): use of ACH could be consistent with rapid bank-to-bank transfers that shift funds quickly.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): a sizable single incoming amount could be consistent with high-value movement requiring scrutiny.\n- dayofweek (raises suspicion): a Sunday transaction could reflect activity outside normal business hours or patterns.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): the specific sending bank ID slightly reduces concern and may reflect an established banking relationship.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (raises suspicion): payment in Saudi riyal could indicate region-specific or cross-border currency flow.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes are accurate, they could be consistent with high-value ACH activity in Saudi riyals occurring on a Sunday and may indicate atypical timing or cross-border currency usage."
