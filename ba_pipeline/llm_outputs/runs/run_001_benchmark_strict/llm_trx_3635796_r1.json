  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness score is driven by raising signals such as use of ACH, a large transaction amount, and occurrence on Sunday, which together increase concern about automated or atypical timing and value. Some factors lower concern \u2014 receiving_currency_euro and an amount_ratio of 1 \u2014 which could indicate transactions in a familiar currency or equal paid/received amounts that reduce uncertainty but do not outweigh the raising signals.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion) \u2014 ACH payment could be consistent with automated or batch transfers that may indicate higher transactional risk.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) \u2014 a large received amount could reflect unusually high inbound value and could be indicative of heightened risk.\n- dayofweek (raises suspicion) \u2014 occurring on Sunday could be consistent with off\u2011hours or atypical timing that may warrant attention.\n- receiving_currency_euro (lowers suspicion) \u2014 euro as the receiving currency could reduce ambiguity if the counterparty or business operates in euros.\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion) \u2014 an amount_ratio of 1 could indicate identical paid and received amounts, which might reflect straightforward passthrough activity.\n\ninvestigation_context: If confirmed, the combination of ACH on a weekend with a large, matched amount could be consistent with automated high\u2011value transfers that increase AML concern."
