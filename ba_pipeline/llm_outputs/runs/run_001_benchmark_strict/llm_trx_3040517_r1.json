  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is very low because multiple strong signals lower concern \u2014 notably the transaction is not ACH, originates from a specific sending bank, and is recorded as a cash payment in euros on a weekday. A small offsetting influence comes from the payment amount recorded and the absence of a credit-card payment, which slightly raise concern but do not outweigh the lowering factors.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the use of a non-ACH method could be consistent with routine non-electronic settlement.\n- from_bank=21387 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the identified sending bank is associated here with lower concern in this context.\n- payment_format_cash=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a cash payment may indicate an immediate, straightforward transfer rather than layered electronic routing.\n- amount_paid=1713.07 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment size could, in some cases, warrant attention if it matches known structuring or unusual thresholds.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 absence of a credit-card transaction might reflect alternative channels that sometimes merit closer look.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these factors are accurate, the pattern could be consistent with a routine cash euro payment from the specified banks, though the payment amount and non-credit-card channel may merit contextual review."
