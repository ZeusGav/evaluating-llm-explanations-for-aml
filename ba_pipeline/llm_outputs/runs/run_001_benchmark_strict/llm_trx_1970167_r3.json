  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is driven up because the payment was sent by ACH, involved a sizeable single amount, and was received at the specified receiving bank, which together raise concern about an unusual electronic transfer. Some lowering signals \u2014 the identified sending bank and that the funds were received in euros \u2014 may lessen immediate concern if they match expected counterparties or normal currency use, but they do not fully offset the other flags.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion): ACH payment could be consistent with rapid electronic transfers that warrant closer attention.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): A relatively large received amount could indicate atypical value for this flow.\n- to_bank (raises suspicion): Receipt at the indicated receiving bank may align with patterns of interest for review.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): The sending bank identifier may lower concern if it corresponds to an expected counterparty.\n- receiving_currency_euro (lowers suspicion): Receiving in euros may reduce worry if euro payments are normal for the parties.\ninvestigation_context: If these factor patterns are confirmed, they could be consistent with either atypical ACH activity or legitimate high-value euro transfers depending on contextual information."
