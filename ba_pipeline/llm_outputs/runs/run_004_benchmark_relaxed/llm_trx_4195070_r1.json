  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The suspiciousness score (0.000070) is very low because every top factor listed reduces concern. Key lowering signals include non\u2011ACH routing, a cash payment flag, matching payment/received amounts in the same currency (shekel), late\u2011evening and mid\u2011week timing, and the specific sending and receiving bank identifiers \u2014 together these attributes point toward a routine domestic transaction pattern and explain the low score.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion): the absence of an ACH indicator suggests the transfer was not routed as an ACH payment, which here reduces concern and could be consistent with other, lower\u2011risk payment methods.\n- from_bank=23833 (lowers suspicion): the sending bank ID is among factors that lower suspicion, which may indicate a routine relationship or expected counterparty for this customer.\n- payment_format_cash=1 (lowers suspicion): the cash payment flag lowers suspicion in this context and could be consistent with ordinary cash deposits or withdrawals.\n- hour=22 (lowers suspicion): the transaction occurring at hour 22 lowers suspicion and may reflect late\u2011evening activity that can be part of normal customer behavior.\n- amount_received=1484.92 (lowers suspicion): this received amount lowers suspicion and could be within an expected or routine range for the customer or channel.\n- receiving_currency_shekel=1 (lowers suspicion): receiving currency = shekel lowers suspicion and may indicate domestic currency use rather than cross\u2011border conversion.\n- to_bank=142836 (lowers suspicion): the receiving bank ID lowers suspicion, which might reflect a routine destination or established counterparty.\n- amount_paid=1484.92 (lowers suspicion): the paid amount lowers suspicion; equality with the received amount could indicate no currency conversion or fee adjustments.\n- payment_currency_shekel=1 (lowers suspicion): payment currency = shekel lowers suspicion and is consistent with payment and receipt in the same domestic currency.\n- dayofweek=3 (lowers suspicion): the day of week (3) lowers suspicion and may correspond to typical mid\u2011week transactional activity.\ninvestigation_context: Given only the listed attributes, the pattern could be consistent with a routine, domestic cash payment between the identified banks late on day 3, involving the same shekel amount paid and received. This explanation is conditional on the factors shown and does not incorporate any other account, customer, or external information that could change the assessment."
