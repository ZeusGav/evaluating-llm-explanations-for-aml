  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The very low suspiciousness score reflects many factors that lower concern (non\u2011ACH routing, a cash indicator, Swiss franc as payment/receiving currency, specific sending/receiving bank IDs, evening timing, weekday timing, and the received amount). One factor \u2014 the payment not being in US dollars \u2014 slightly raises concern, but it is outweighed by the other lowering signals.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (lowers suspicion): the payment was not sent via ACH, which could be consistent with transfers conducted through alternative channels and thus reduces concern.\n- payment_format_cash (lowers suspicion): the transaction is marked as cash, which may be consistent with routine cash-based activity in some customer or business contexts.\n- from_bank=118 (lowers suspicion): the sending bank identifier aligns with patterns that reduce concern and may reflect a routine source institution.\n- receiving_currency_swiss_franc (lowers suspicion): the funds are received in Swiss francs, which could be consistent with expected currency usage for this counterparty or region.\n- to_bank=240304 (lowers suspicion): the receiving bank identifier aligns with patterns that lower concern and may indicate a standard destination institution.\n- hour=20 (lowers suspicion): the transaction occurred in the 20:00 hour, which may match normal customer timing or settlement cycles and thus reduce concern.\n- amount_received (lowers suspicion): the amount received is at a level that may be consistent with ordinary business or customer payments and therefore lowers concern in this context.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (raises suspicion): the payment was not in US dollars, which could indicate cross\u2011currency activity or exposure that slightly raises concern in some scenarios.\n- payment_currency_swiss_franc (lowers suspicion): the payment currency being Swiss francs may be consistent with the receiving currency and thus reduces concern.\n- dayofweek=3 (lowers suspicion): the transaction occurred on day 3 of the week, which may align with normal weekday activity and therefore reduce concern.\ninvestigation_context: If considered in context, the combination of non\u2011ACH routing, a cash indicator, Swiss franc usage for both payment and receipt, specific sending/receiving banks, timing, and the amount together suggest patterns that reduce overall concern. However, if the absence of US dollars is relevant for this customer or transaction type, that single increasing factor could signal cross\u2011currency dynamics that might be meaningful when seen alongside other risk indicators."
