  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The very low suspiciousness score (0.000944) reflects multiple factors that reduce concern \u2014 notably non-ACH and cheque payment formats, receipt and payment in shekels, identifiable sending/receiving banks, a moderate amount, and a late-hour timestamp \u2014 which together outweigh a couple of signals that raise concern (transaction on a Sunday and not in US dollars).\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion): absence of an ACH payment could be consistent with non-electronic or routine settlement methods, reducing automated-payment risk.\n- from_bank=1198 (lowers suspicion): this sending bank ID contributes to lower concern and may reflect a regular or expected counterparty.\n- receiving_currency_shekel=1 (lowers suspicion): receiving in shekels lowers concern and could indicate domestic currency settlement consistent with routine local activity.\n- hour=23 (lowers suspicion): a 23:00 timestamp lowers concern here and might reflect end-of-day or after-hours processing.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion): payment by cheque lowers concern and may indicate a documented, manual payment method.\n- amount_received=13311 (lowers suspicion): the received amount lowers concern and could be within expected operational ranges for this relationship.\n- dayofweek=6 (raises suspicion): occurring on day 6 (Sunday) raises concern, since weekend timing can be atypical for business flows and may merit review.\n- payment_currency_shekel=1 (lowers suspicion): payment in shekels lowers concern and supports a domestic-currency pattern.\n- to_bank=245441 (lowers suspicion): this receiving bank ID lowers concern and may indicate a known or routine beneficiary bank.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion): not being in US dollars raises concern here and could reflect a currency mismatch relative to expected channels.\ninvestigation_context: Given these factors, the overall profile is driven toward low suspicion because many indicators point to routine, domestic, cheque-based transfers between known banks processed late in the day; however, the weekend timing and non-USD currency are conditional signals that might warrant contextual confirmation if such patterns would be unexpected for this customer or business relationship."
