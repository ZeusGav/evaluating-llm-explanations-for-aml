  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Most top factors point toward lower risk \u2014 the transaction is not ACH, uses yen on both sides, involves the same sending and receiving bank ID, is by cheque, occurs at hour 2 on day 3, and the received amount is modest \u2014 only the absence of US dollar as the payment currency pulls slightly in the other direction, so overall the score is very low.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the transaction did not use ACH rails, which could be consistent with alternative or documented payment methods that reduce this specific risk signal.\n- from_bank=15 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the sending bank ID is 15, which in combination with the receiving bank may indicate intra-institution movement and thus lower this risk dimension.\n- payment_currency_yen=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment currency is yen, which may reflect domestic-currency activity and so reduces this particular concern.\n- to_bank=15 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank ID is also 15, supporting the possibility of an internal transfer that lowers suspicion on this axis.\n- receiving_currency_yen=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving currency is yen as well, aligning with the payment currency and reducing cross-currency complexity in this context.\n- hour=2 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the transaction time is hour 2, which could be consistent with scheduled or automated processing rather than irregular behavior.\n- amount_received=36250.8 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the reported amount falls into a level that, in some contexts, may reflect routine business activity rather than an extreme outlier.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment was made by cheque, which may provide a paper trail or institutional controls that reduce this specific risk indicator.\n- dayofweek=3 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the transaction occurred on day index 3, which could correspond to a normal business-day timing and thus lower this signal.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment was not in US dollars, which in some contexts may introduce additional screening considerations or indicate non-USD activity that slightly increases this risk signal.\ninvestigation_context: Taken together, these factors could explain a very low suspiciousness score because most indicators point to an intra-bank yen cheque payment at the listed time and amount, although the non-USD currency flag is a minor countervailing signal to consider contextually."
