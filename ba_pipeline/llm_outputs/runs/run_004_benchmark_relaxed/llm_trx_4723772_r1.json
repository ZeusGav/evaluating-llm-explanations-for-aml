  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness score is driven mainly by payment attributes that raise concern \u2014 an ACH transfer conducted on a Sunday, settled in Saudi riyals, and for an amount of 31,774.2 \u2014 together with the absence of USD/cheque/credit-card/euro indicators. These factors raising suspicion are partially offset by the transaction originating from sending bank ID 48308, which lowers suspicion in this context.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion): the transaction used ACH, which could be consistent with electronic bank-to-bank movement rather than card or cheque channels.\n- dayofweek=6 (raises suspicion): the transfer occurred on a Sunday, which may indicate activity outside normal business days and could be notable depending on expected behavior.\n- from_bank=48308 (lowers suspicion): the sending bank ID is 48308, which in this scoring context reduces concern and could reflect a familiar or lower-risk source institution.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion): the payment currency is Saudi riyal, which may indicate use of a regional currency rather than more common global currencies in the relationship.\n- amount_received=31774.2 (raises suspicion): the received amount (31,774.2) could be consistent with higher-value movement that merits attention depending on expected customer activity.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion): the receiving currency is also Saudi riyal, reinforcing that the flow is denominated in that currency and may be relevant to jurisdictional or counterparty considerations.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion): the absence of a US dollar payment flag increases suspicion here, which could reflect avoidance of a widely used currency in favor of alternatives.\n- payment_format_cheque=0 (raises suspicion): the transaction was not a cheque, and this absence contributes to the overall elevated score in this context.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion): the transaction was not via credit card, and this absence contributes to the elevated score given the other electronic-transfer indicators.\n- receiving_currency_euro=0 (raises suspicion): the absence of a euro receiving-currency flag adds to the pattern of non-euro, non-USD, Saudi-riyal denominated movement that raises the score.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these inputs are accurate, the combination of an ACH transfer on a Sunday, denominated and received in Saudi riyals for the noted amount, and the absence of USD/cheque/credit-card/euro indicators could be consistent with atypical payment patterns for this customer or corridor; conversely, the origin from sending bank 48308 may temper concern. These characteristics may warrant contextual review (e.g., expected customer profile, counterparty relationships, and business rationale) to determine whether the pattern is explainable or requires further scrutiny."
