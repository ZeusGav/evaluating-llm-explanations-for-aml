  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is very low because multiple observed factors point toward a routine, same-currency cheque settlement between identified banks on a weekday (which lowers suspicion). One factor \u2014 the absence of US dollar as the payment currency \u2014 pushes the signal in the opposite direction (raises suspicion) and could be notable depending on the customer or corridor context.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment was not routed via ACH, which could be consistent with an alternative payment method or offline settlement.\n- from_bank=19777 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the identified sending bank is associated with a lower concern signal, which could reflect an expected or known counterparty relationship.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the use of cheque as the payment method could be consistent with corporate or manual settlement practices.\n- amount_paid=511713 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the reported paid amount contributes to a lower concern signal and, together with the received amount, may reflect a straightforward transaction value.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 being denominated in Saudi riyal reduces the concern signal and may indicate currency alignment with the receiving side.\n- amount_received=511713 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the received amount aligns with the paid amount, which could be consistent with a direct transfer or settlement without currency mismatch.\n- to_bank=48308 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the identified receiving bank contributes to a lower concern signal, which might reflect a routine counterparty for this flow.\n- dayofweek=4 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the transaction occurring on a weekday could be consistent with normal business activity and reduces the concern signal.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment currency being Saudi riyal aligns with the receiving currency and lowers the concern signal.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the absence of US dollar as the payment currency increases the concern signal and could be notable if the customer or payment corridor typically uses USD or if non-USD routing is unusual for this relationship.\ninvestigation_context: If this customer, counterparty pair, or payment corridor normally operates in US dollars, the lack of USD could be a relevant anomaly; however, if dealings typically occur in Saudi riyal and by cheque between these banks on weekdays, the overall pattern would be consistent with routine settlement."
