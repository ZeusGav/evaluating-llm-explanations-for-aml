  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score 0.051330 reflects a mix of signals: a single strong raising factor (the sender bank being from_bank=70) increases concern, while several factors lower concern \u2014 notably cheque payment, non-ACH format, late-hour timing, rupee as payment and receiving currency, and a specific receiving bank \u2014 resulting in a relatively low overall suspiciousness. Minor increases come from the transaction not being in USD or EUR.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=70 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the transaction originates from sending bank 70, which could increase concern if that sender institution is unfamiliar or has a history of problematic activity.\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment is not an ACH transfer, which could be consistent with a less automated or more traceable payment channel and thus lower automated risk.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment was made by cheque, which may be seen as more traditional/traceable and could reduce concern compared with some electronic formats.\n- hour=22 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the transaction occurred at hour 22 (late evening), which could be consistent with routine end-of-day or after-hours processing rather than indicative of atypical timing.\n- receiving_currency_rupee=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving currency is rupee, which could align with expected local currency flows and reduce cross-currency concerns.\n- payment_currency_rupee=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment currency is rupee, which may indicate the payment and receipt are in the same currency and thus lower currency-exchange risk.\n- to_bank=112497 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank ID 112497 is associated with a lowering signal, which could indicate a familiar or expected recipient institution in context.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment is not in US dollars, which could slightly raise questions about alternative routing or non-USD counterparties in a context where USD would normally be expected.\n- dayofweek=2 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the transaction fell on day 2 of the week, which could reflect regular weekday activity and lower timing-based concern.\n- receiving_currency_euro=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the receiving currency is not euro, a minor factor that could signal non-EUR counterparties or alternative currency routing if EUR usage would be typical.\ninvestigation_context: If the sender bank (from_bank=70) is unusual for this customer or has prior adverse information, that single raising signal could be a relevant contextual concern; conversely, if the cheque payment, rupee currency use, late-hour timing, and the receiving bank are consistent with the customer\u2019s normal business relationships or known counterparties, they could explain the low score. The fact that the funds are not in USD or EUR is a small additional point to note if currency routing or cross-border activity is otherwise expected."
