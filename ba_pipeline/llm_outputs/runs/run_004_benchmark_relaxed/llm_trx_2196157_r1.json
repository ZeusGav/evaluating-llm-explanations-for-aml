  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness score is driven mainly by an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) of 15,373 Saudi riyals occurring on a Sunday at midday, sent to the receiving bank (to_bank=222) and not using credit card or cheque rails; these characteristics raise concern. A single factor \u2014 the identified sending bank (from_bank=249118) \u2014 reduces the concern somewhat, but does not offset the other increasing factors.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 an ACH payment could be consistent with non-card electronic movement of funds, which may be used to transfer larger sums between accounts.\n- dayofweek=6 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the transaction occurred on Sunday, which could indicate activity outside typical business days or expected patterns.\n- amount_received=15373 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the amount received is substantial and could be consistent with significant fund movement that warrants review.\n- from_bank=249118 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the specific sending bank is associated here with a downward signal, which could reflect a known or lower-risk sending relationship in this context.\n- amount_paid=15373 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the paid amount matches the received amount, which could indicate a straightforward transfer of funds rather than a split or fee-adjusted payment.\n- hour=12 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the transaction occurred at noon, which in combination with other factors may align with transaction timing patterns worth checking.\n- to_bank=222 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank is associated with an upward signal, which could reflect increased attention on that destination in this context.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 absence of a credit card payment method may indicate use of bank-transfer rails instead of consumer card networks, which can be relevant for AML considerations.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment is in Saudi riyals, and currency choice in combination with other attributes may be noteworthy for geographic or currency-flow analysis.\n- payment_format_cheque=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 this was not a cheque payment; the combination of non-cheque, non-card electronic transfer attributes may be consistent with direct bank-to-bank transfers.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these factor values are accurate, the pattern\u2014an ACH transfer of 15,373 SAR on a Sunday at noon to bank 222, not sent by card or cheque\u2014could be consistent with a sizeable, direct electronic movement of funds that merits contextual review; however, the identified sending bank (from_bank=249118) shows a mitigating signal that might reflect a lower concern for this particular origin."
