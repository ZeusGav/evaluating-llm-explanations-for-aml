  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The low suspiciousness score (0.015628) reflects one notable raising factor (the sending bank and a small raise from the payment-side amount) being outweighed by several lowering factors. Multiple attributes \u2014 including payment method indicators, receiving bank, currencies in shekel, timing (hour and day), and the received amount \u2014 collectively point toward characteristics that may be consistent with routine or expected activity, which lowers the overall concern despite the origin-related signal.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=70 (raises suspicion) \u2014 could indicate the payment originates from a sending bank that may warrant additional attention.\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with a non-ACH method, which may align with manual or offline payment flows.\n- to_bank=244187 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could indicate the funds are directed to a receiving bank that may be an expected or normal destination.\n- receiving_currency_shekel=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with settlement in local currency and routine currency usage.\n- payment_format_cheque=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with a cheque-based payment, which may have different controls or documentation than electronic transfers.\n- hour=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with overnight processing or scheduled settlement activity.\n- amount_received=7592.05 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with a payment size that aligns with normal business transactions.\n- payment_currency_shekel=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with the payment being made in the same local currency, reducing currency-mismatch concerns.\n- dayofweek=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with business-day activity occurring on a Monday.\n- amount_paid=7592.05 (raises suspicion) \u2014 could indicate a payment-side amount that merits attention when considered alongside the sending bank origin.\ninvestigation_context: Given these factors, the limited elevation in concern is primarily linked to the sending bank and the payment-side amount, while the payment method, receiving bank, currency indicators, timing, and received amount may be consistent with routine transactions; these conditional considerations together explain why the overall suspiciousness remains low."
