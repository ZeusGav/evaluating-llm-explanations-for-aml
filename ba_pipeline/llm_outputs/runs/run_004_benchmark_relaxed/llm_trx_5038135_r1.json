  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness score is driven mainly by an ACH bank transfer in Saudi riyals for a sizable amount (the payment and receipt amounts match), combined with the transaction not being in US dollars or euros and not using a credit card \u2014 these factors raise concern. That upward signal is partially offset by the specific sending and receiving bank IDs, which lower suspicion and could indicate familiar banking counterparties.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the transaction used an ACH bank transfer, which could be consistent with high-value electronic bank-to-bank movement.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment is denominated in Saudi riyal, which may indicate a regional currency flow rather than global USD/EUR clearing.\n- amount_received=60777.8 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the received amount is relatively large and may indicate a significant single transfer.\n- from_bank=150240 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the specific sending bank ID lowers concern, which could reflect a known or expected counterparty institution.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the receiving leg is also in Saudi riyal, which may suggest a same-currency movement within the region.\n- amount_paid=60777.8 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the paid amount matches the received amount, which might reflect a straightforward transfer without conversion or layering.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment is not in US dollars, which could indicate avoidance of major currency rails or a regional-only transfer.\n- to_bank=48309 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the specific receiving bank ID lowers concern and could point to an expected beneficiary bank.\n- receiving_currency_euro=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the transaction is not in euros, reinforcing the regional currency pattern that may merit attention.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 the payment was not by credit card, which might reflect an institutional bank transfer rather than retail card activity.\ninvestigation_context: If this transaction is an ACH transfer in Saudi riyals for a single large, matched amount, that pattern could be consistent with significant regional fund movement and may warrant review for source, purpose, and beneficiary relationships. Conversely, if the sending and receiving bank IDs represent known, vetted counterparties, that context could reduce immediate concern."
