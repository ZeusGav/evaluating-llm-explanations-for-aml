  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is elevated primarily because the payment was sent via ACH (not a credit card) and the payment is not in US dollars while the paid amount shows a modest upward influence; these characteristics could be consistent with cross-bank or cross-currency movement that raises concern. Those signals are partially offset by factors that lower suspicion \u2014 the specific sending and receiving banks, the amount received, the weekday and early-morning hour, and receipt in euros \u2014 which may reflect routine or expected activity.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion): Use of an ACH transfer could be consistent with automated or bank-to-bank flows that sometimes warrant attention depending on context.\n- from_bank=236867 (lowers suspicion): The identified sending bank here reduces the score; this might reflect a sending relationship or bank profile associated with lower concern for this payment.\n- amount_received=2217.25 (lowers suspicion): The received amount at this level decreases suspicion and could indicate a transaction size that is not unusual for routine activity.\n- dayofweek=4 (lowers suspicion): The timing on this day of week lowers the score and may be consistent with regular business-day patterns.\n- hour=6 (lowers suspicion): The early-morning hour reduces the score and might reflect normal clearing or scheduled processing times rather than atypical timing.\n- to_bank=43923 (lowers suspicion): The receiving bank identifier contributes to lower suspicion, which could indicate a typical counterparty relationship for this payment.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion): The payment is not in US dollars, which could be consistent with cross-currency or cross-border movement that raises additional scrutiny in some contexts.\n- receiving_currency_euro=1 (lowers suspicion): The funds are received in euros, which here reduces concern and might align with expected currency routing for this account or corridor.\n- amount_paid=2217.25 (raises suspicion): The paid amount contributes slightly to higher suspicion; depending on the customer profile this payment size could be notable.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion): The absence of a credit card payment method increases the score and could indicate a bank transfer pattern rather than consumer card activity.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these payment characteristics are inconsistent with this customer\u2019s normal behavior or expected business activity, they could be indicative of atypical cross-bank or cross-currency movement; if they align with known account relationships and expected currency corridors, they may reflect routine activity."
