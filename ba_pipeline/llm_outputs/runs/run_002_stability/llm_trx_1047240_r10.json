  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +3.11968, direction: increase) — the payment method being ACH is the single largest driver increasing the model score.\n- amount_received = 14737.5 (SHAP +0.936787, direction: increase) and amount_paid = 14737.5 (SHAP +0.662486, direction: increase) — the material dollar amounts on both received and paid sides further increase the score.\n- dayofweek = 5 (SHAP +0.35469, direction: increase) — the transaction occurring on day 5 (Saturday, given 0=Mon..6=Sun) contributed additional upward pressure on the score.\n- from_bank = 15 (SHAP −0.327358, direction: decrease) — the sending bank identifier reduced the score somewhat (a moderating factor).\n\nConclusion:\nThe detection model flagged this transaction mainly because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) with relatively large equal amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 14,737.5) that occurred on dayofweek=5 (Saturday); these features had the largest positive SHAP contributions. The from_bank feature (from_bank=15) partially offset the risk signal. Conditionally, if ACH transfers of this size and timing (Saturday) are unusual for the relevant business context, the transaction may warrant further review."
