  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — SHAP +3.11968 (increase): the use of ACH is the single largest positive driver of the flag.\n- amount_received (value=14737.5) — SHAP +0.936787 (increase): the receiving amount materially increased the model score.\n- amount_paid (value=14737.5) — SHAP +0.662486 (increase): the paid amount also increased the score; the identical paid/received values indicate a direct transfer of 14,737.50 that contributed to the flag.\n- dayofweek (value=5 — per fact sheet 0=Mon..6=Sun, so Saturday) — SHAP +0.35469 (increase): the transaction occurring on day index 5 increased the model score.\n- from_bank (value=15) — SHAP −0.327358 (decrease): the sending bank ID partially reduced the model score (a modest offset to the positive drivers).\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) of approximately 14,737.50 (amount_received and amount_paid both 14737.5) occurring on dayofweek=5, with the sending bank (from_bank=15) modestly lowering the score. \n- If the transaction matches those feature values (ACH, equal paid/received ≈14,737.50, dayofweek=5), the model’s output is consistent with the listed driver effects."
