  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) strongly increased the model score (SHAP +2.7343) — the transaction being ACH is the single largest driver of the flag.\n- amount_paid (16269.7) increased the score (SHAP +0.9757) — the payment size materially contributed to the alert.\n- amount_received (16269.7) also increased the score (SHAP +0.9127) — the received amount reinforces the payment magnitude signal.\n- to_bank (10) contributed a smaller positive effect (SHAP +0.4243) — sending to bank ID 10 increased model suspicion modestly.\n- dayofweek (4) exerted a negative effect (SHAP −0.4583) — the transaction day reduced the model’s suspicion relative to other days.\n- from_bank (23833) exerted a modest negative effect (SHAP −0.2862) — the sending bank ID lowered the score slightly.\n\nConclusion:\nThe alert is primarily driven by the transaction being an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) combined with relatively large payment/receipt amounts (amount_paid and amount_received = 16269.7), with additional modest upward contribution from to_bank=10. Offsetting factors were dayofweek=4 and from_bank=23833, which reduced the model score but did not overcome the dominant ACH and amount signals. If further review is needed, focus first on verifying the ACH payment details and the counterparties at to_bank=10 and from_bank=23833."
