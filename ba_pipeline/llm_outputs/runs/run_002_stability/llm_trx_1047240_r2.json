  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+3.11968, direction=increase): the transaction being ACH is the largest single driver raising the model score.\n- amount_received (value=14737.5; SHAP=+0.936787, direction=increase) and amount_paid (value=14737.5; SHAP=+0.662486, direction=increase): the reported amounts (equal received and paid) meaningfully increased the score.\n- dayofweek (value=5; SHAP=+0.35469, direction=increase): the day feature increased the score (per feature definition, dayofweek=5 corresponds to Saturday).\n- from_bank (value=15; SHAP=-0.327358, direction=decrease): the sending bank ID partially decreased (offset) the model score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag is primarily driven by the payment method being ACH (payment_format_ach=1) combined with the relatively large reported amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 14,737.5), with the transaction occurring on dayofweek=5 (Saturday) also increasing the score; the sending bank (from_bank=15) modestly reduced the model’s risk contribution. If these feature values reflect an ACH transfer of ~14.7k processed on a Saturday, the model’s elevated score (and resulting flag) is largely explained by those factors."
