  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The model's score was driven primarily by the payment being ACH: payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.87879 → increases score).  \n- Timing contributed: dayofweek = 6 (SHAP +0.621813 → increases score).  \n- Currency contributed positively: payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1 (SHAP +0.606203 → increases score).  \n- Two bank identifiers partially offset the increase: from_bank = 119 (SHAP -0.428745 → decreases score) and to_bank = 49365 (SHAP -0.304935 → decreases score).\n\nConclusion:\n- The elevated flag is mainly attributable to an ACH payment (payment_format_ach) in Saudi Riyals (payment_currency_saudi_riyal) that occurred on dayofweek = 6; these three features together produced the largest positive contributions. The sending and receiving bank IDs (from_bank, to_bank) reduced the model score but did not fully offset the positive drivers.  \n- Conditional/hedged observation: if ACH transfers in SAR on dayofweek = 6 are atypical for the profile under review, that combination likely explains the flag (based solely on the named features)."
