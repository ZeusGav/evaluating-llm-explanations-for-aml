  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — SHAP +2.87879 (increase): the use of ACH is the dominant contributor raising the model score.\n- dayofweek (value=6 → Sunday) — SHAP +0.621813 (increase): transaction timing on day 6 increases the score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — SHAP +0.606203 (increase): payment currency = Saudi Riyal contributes to a higher score.\n- amount_received (value=31783.0) — SHAP +0.295498 (increase): the received amount provides a modest upward contribution.\n- from_bank (value=119) — SHAP -0.428745 (decrease): originating bank ID reduces the overall score (partially offsets increases).\n- to_bank (value=49365) — SHAP -0.304935 (decrease): receiving bank ID also reduces the score (partial offset).\n\nConclusion:\nThe alert is primarily driven by payment_format_ach = 1, combined with dayofweek = 6 (Sunday), payment_currency_saudi_riyal = 1, and a non-trivial amount_received = 31783.0, which together raise the model score. This elevated signal is partially offset by the originating and receiving bank identifiers (from_bank = 119 and to_bank = 49365) that lower the score. If ACH payments in SAR occurring on day 6 corresponded to higher-risk patterns in the model’s training data, the model’s flagging behavior is consistent with those learned patterns."
