  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.90216, direction: increase): the use of ACH is the single largest contributor raising the model score.\n- amount_received = 15968.2 (SHAP +0.899807, direction: increase) and amount_paid = 15968.2 (SHAP +0.764144, direction: increase): the transaction value (~15,968.2) increases the score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (SHAP +0.781602, direction: increase): occurrence on day 6 (Sunday per the fact sheet) increases the score.\n- from_bank = 908 (SHAP -0.922438, direction: decrease): the sending bank (ID 908) partially reduces the model score.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach = 1) of a relatively large amount (~15,968.2) that occurred on dayofweek = 6 (Sunday); these drivers together raised the flag despite a lowering contribution from from_bank = 908.\n- If further review is needed, focus checks on the ACH payment details, the high payment/receipt amounts, and the timing (dayofweek = 6) to determine whether these factors are consistent with expected customer behavior."
