You are an AML compliance analyst writing for a non-technical investigator.

Task:
Translate the listed factors into a human-readable rationale for why the suspiciousness score is 0.011069.

Hard rules:
- Use ONLY the factors listed below as evidence. Do NOT invent additional evidence or dataset-specific facts.
- Do NOT mention SHAP, ML, models, or internal mechanisms.
- Do NOT use numeric SHAP values in your wording. Treat them only as internal signals of which factors matter.
- You MAY add generic AML context ONLY as possibilities, using conditional language (e.g., "could be consistent with...", "may indicate...", "might reflect...").
- Never state "is rare/common" or similar dataset claims unless explicitly stated in the factors/definitions.
- direction "increase" => raises suspicion; "decrease" => lowers suspicion.
- Keep the output <= 150 words total.
- Output EXACTLY this format (no extra text):

short_explanation: <EXACTLY 2 sentences. Summarize the overall rationale, mentioning both raising and lowering factors if applicable.>
key_factors:
- <EXACTLY 5 bullet lines; each starts with "- "; each line must include at least one factor name AND explicitly state (raises suspicion) or (lowers suspicion), plus a short conditional interpretation.>
investigation_context: <EXACTLY 1 sentence using conditional language; no action steps, no instructions.>
