No listed top factors raise suspicion, so their combined effect yields a very low suspiciousness score.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=7 (lowers suspicion); could reflect a sending bank associated with routine transfers.\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion); could indicate a standard ACH-style payment channel rather than an unusual method.\n- payment_format_reinvestment=1 (lowers suspicion); could be consistent with reinvestment-type activity that appears internal or expected.\n- payment_currency_rupee=1 (lowers suspicion); could reflect transactions conducted in the local currency rather than cross-currency movement.\n- amount_paid=325.55 (lowers suspicion); could align with modest transaction size consistent with routine payments.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes match the customer's normal behavior, the low score may indicate routine activity rather than suspicious conduct."
