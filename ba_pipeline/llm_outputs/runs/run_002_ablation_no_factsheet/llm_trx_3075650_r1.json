  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high score reflects an ACH-format transfer combined with a large, equal amount received and paid in US dollars, which could be consistent with high-risk fund movement and thus raises suspicion. No explicit lowering factors are listed among the top signals, so the listed increases dominate the assessment.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion) \u2014 presence of ACH could indicate automated bank transfer channels that may facilitate rapid fund movement.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) \u2014 the large received amount could be consistent with high-value transactions that merit scrutiny.\n- amount_paid (raises suspicion) \u2014 the matching paid amount may suggest pass-through activity or structuring of a single large sum.\n- payment_format_cheque=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 absence of cheque usage could indicate avoidance of paper-based payment trails.\n- receiving_currency_us_dollar (raises suspicion) \u2014 receipt in USD could reflect hard-currency movement that may be relevant in cross-jurisdictional risk.\ninvestigation_context: If these factor patterns hold, they may indicate concentrated ACH-based USD movement of a sizable sum that could warrant closer review."
