None of the top contributing factors increase suspicion among the provided signals, so the overall evidence points toward low apparent risk. \nkey_factors:\n- amount_paid=17.75 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a low transaction value that could be consistent with routine small payments.\n- amount_received=17.75 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 identical received amount that may indicate no value mismatch.\n- amount_ratio=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a one-to-one ratio that could reflect a straightforward single-leg transfer.\n- payment_format_wire=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a wire payment attribute that might reflect a standard bank transfer method.\n- from_bank=220504 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a domestic bank identifier that could be consistent with local banking activity.\ninvestigation_context: If these recorded attributes are accurate, they may indicate a routine, low-value domestic wire with matched amounts rather than activity that raises immediate concern."
