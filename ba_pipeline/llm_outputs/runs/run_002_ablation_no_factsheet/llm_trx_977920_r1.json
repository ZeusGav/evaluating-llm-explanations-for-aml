None of the top listed factors indicates increased risk.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=15 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 if this is an expected origin, it could reflect routine sending.\n- to_bank=228009 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 if this is a regular recipient, it may indicate normal payee behavior.\n- payment_format_credit_card=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 if paid by card, it could be ordinary consumer spending.\n- amount_paid=173.9 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 if the amount matches typical payments, it may not indicate concern.\n- receiving_currency_australian_dollar=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 if AUD aligns with the customer's normal currency, this might reflect standard domestic activity.\ninvestigation_context: If account history and customer profile align with these factors, the transaction could be consistent with routine activity."
