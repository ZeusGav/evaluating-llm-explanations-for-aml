  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is very low because several transaction attributes (near-equal amount ratio, very small amount paid, routing through listed banks, absence of ACH, midday weekday timing, and the payment format flagged as bitcoin) collectively lower concern. A couple of factors\u2014an amount being received and the payment currency being bitcoin\u2014raise limited concern and could be consistent with value transfers that warrant contextual review.\n\nkey_factors:\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion): a near-match between amounts could indicate the payment aligns with expected value and reduces anomaly concern.\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion): a very small paid amount may be consistent with routine or low-risk flows.\n- from_bank and to_bank (lowers suspicion): routing through the recorded origin and destination banks could reflect standard banking rails and lower uncertainty.\n- payment_format_ach and payment_format_bitcoin (lowers suspicion): absence of ACH and presence of a recorded bitcoin format may, in this context, reduce the suspicion signal.\n- amount_received and payment_currency_bitcoin (raises suspicion): a recorded received amount together with bitcoin as the currency could indicate value transfer characteristics that merit contextual attention.\n\ninvestigation_context: If considered relevant, the combination of a received amount and bitcoin currency may point to on-chain or cross-rail transfer patterns that could benefit from contextual information."
