  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach: value=1; largest positive contributor (SHAP +2.87783). The ACH payment format was the dominant factor increasing the model score.\n- amount_received (14365.3) and amount_paid (14365.3): both positive contributors (SHAP +0.841689 and +0.78725). The transaction amount materially raised the score.\n- from_bank: value=22758; negative contributor (SHAP -0.643526). The sending bank reduced the model score, partially offsetting other increases.\n- to_bank: value=12; positive contributor (SHAP +0.491518). The receiving bank increased the score.\n- dayofweek: value=5 (Friday); positive contributor (SHAP +0.430737). The day of week contributed upward to the score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) combined with a relatively large amount (amount_received and amount_paid ≈ 14,365.3), with additional upward contributions from the receiving bank (to_bank=12) and the transaction day (dayofweek=5). This effect was partially offset by the sending bank (from_bank=22758) which lowered the score. If one is assessing risk, the ACH format plus the transaction amount are the principal drivers to review further."
