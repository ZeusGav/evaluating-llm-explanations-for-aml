  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) was the largest driver, contributing +2.82486 (direction: increase) — the model raised the score primarily because the payment was ACH.\n- amount_received (value=16206.4) contributed +0.91414 (direction: increase) — a relatively large received amount increased the score.\n- dayofweek (value=6) contributed +0.76231 (direction: increase) — the transaction occurring on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) increased the score.\n- amount_paid (value=16206.4) contributed +0.58359 (direction: increase) — the paid amount (16206.4) also increased the score.\n- to_bank (value=25981) contributed −0.48166 (direction: decrease) — the receiving bank (to_bank=25981) reduced the model score somewhat but did not offset the increases above.\n\nConclusion:\nThe flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach=1 together with high transaction amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 16206.4) and weekend timing (dayofweek=6), while the to_bank (25981) provided a modest mitigating effect. If these feature values are accurate, the model views this ACH transfer of 16206.4 on a Sunday as higher risk and warrants manual review focused on ACH origin, the transaction amount, and weekend activity."
