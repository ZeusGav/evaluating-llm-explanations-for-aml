One factor, payment_currency_us_dollar=0, slightly raises suspicion because the payment is not in US dollars, but it is outweighed by the lowering factors.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=139793 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with expected behavior from that sending bank.\n- payment_format_credit_card=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 could be consistent with ordinary consumer card payments rather than higher-risk transfer types.\n- amount_paid=40.18 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a low monetary value that may indicate a routine retail-style transaction.\n- receiving_currency_swiss_franc=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 receiving in Swiss franc may reflect normal currency usage for this transfer.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion) \u2014 not being in US dollars may slightly increase scrutiny if USD were anticipated.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes are accurate, the pattern may be more consistent with a low-risk, small-value card payment than with clear indicators of illicit activity."
