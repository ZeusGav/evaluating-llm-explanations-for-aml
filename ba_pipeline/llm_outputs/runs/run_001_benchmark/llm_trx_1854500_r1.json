  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — this feature had the largest positive contribution (SHAP 2.8416, direction: increase). The model weighted an ACH payment strongly toward flagging.\n- amount_received (value=17498.0) — a high received amount contributed positively (SHAP 1.02106, direction: increase).\n- amount_paid (value=17498.0) — the payment amount also increased the score (SHAP 0.650169, direction: increase).\n- to_bank (value=12) — the receiving bank ID contributed further to the increase (SHAP 0.458209, direction: increase).\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (value=1) — paying in US dollars slightly reduced the model score (SHAP -0.143899, direction: decrease), acting as a minor mitigating factor.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged mainly because payment_format_ach=1 combined with relatively large amount_received and amount_paid (both 17,498.0) and the to_bank (ID 12) produced the largest positive SHAP contributions. The fact that payment_currency_us_dollar=1 slightly lowered the score is a small offset but does not outweigh the dominant ACH and amount-driven contributions."
