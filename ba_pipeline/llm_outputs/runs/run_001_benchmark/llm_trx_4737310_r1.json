  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 increased the score substantially (SHAP 2.76488, direction: increase) — the model strongly associates the ACH payment format (feature: payment_format_ach) with flagging.\n- amount_paid = 9099.08 (SHAP 0.684259, increase) and amount_received = 9099.08 (SHAP 0.671048, increase) — the equal, relatively large payment and receipt amounts (features: amount_paid, amount_received) both increased the model score.\n- from_bank = 231212 (SHAP 0.433064, increase) — the sending bank identifier (feature: from_bank) contributed positively to the flag.\n- dayofweek = 5 (SHAP 0.396962, increase) — the transaction occurred on day index 5 (feature: dayofweek), which the model treats as increasing risk.\n- payment_currency_euro = 1 (SHAP 0.15656, increase) — the payment being in euros (feature: payment_currency_euro) modestly increased the score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) in euros (payment_currency_euro) for a matching amount paid/received of 9,099.08 (amount_paid, amount_received) originating from from_bank 231212 and occurring on dayofweek 5 — each of these features increased the model score. If prioritizing review, focus on verifying the ACH payment details, the origin bank (from_bank), and the justification for the equal amounts in this euro-denominated transfer occurring on day index 5."
