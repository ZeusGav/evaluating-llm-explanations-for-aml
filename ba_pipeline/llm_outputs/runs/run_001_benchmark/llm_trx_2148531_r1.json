  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.87547; direction=increase): the payment being ACH was the single largest driver raising the model score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1; SHAP=+0.67731; direction=increase) and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1; SHAP=+0.34126; direction=increase): the payment and receiving currency indicators for Saudi Riyal both increased the score.\n- dayofweek (value=6; SHAP=+0.60278; direction=increase): the transaction occurring on day index 6 (per fact sheet mapping) increased the score.\n- amount_received (value=46154.1; SHAP=+0.50341; direction=increase): the received amount contributed positively to the flag.\n- from_bank (value=119; SHAP=-0.41556; direction=decrease) and to_bank (value=48211; SHAP=-0.34716; direction=decrease): these specific bank identifiers reduced the model score (partial offsets).\n\nConclusion:\nThe alert is primarily driven by the transaction being an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) denominated in Saudi Riyal (payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1), processed on dayofweek=6, and for amount_received=46154.1 — all of which increased the model’s risk score. This elevated signal was partially mitigated by the negative contributions from from_bank=119 and to_bank=48211. \n\nPotentially helpful, hedged observations (derived from named drivers only):\n- If both payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1, this suggests the payment and receipt are in the same currency (Saudi Riyal), i.e., likely no currency conversion. \n- dayofweek=6 corresponds to Sunday per the provided mapping."
