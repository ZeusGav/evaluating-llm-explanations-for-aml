  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.8739, direction: increase): The model’s top driver is that this is an ACH payment, which strongly increases the flag score.\n- amount_received = 12,843.2 (SHAP +1.03098, direction: increase) and amount_paid = 12,843.2 (SHAP +0.605992, direction: increase): Relatively large and equal received/paid amounts both contribute to a higher score; the equality of these two reported amounts is a direct feature fact.\n- from_bank = 147241 (SHAP -0.523827, direction: decrease): The sending bank ID reduces the score (partial mitigating factor).\n- dayofweek = 5 (SHAP +0.453197, direction: increase) and hour = 12 (SHAP +0.24078, direction: increase): Timing (day 5 and hour 12) modestly increases the score. (Per feature definition, dayofweek=5 corresponds to Saturday.)\n\nConclusion:\n- The transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach) with relatively large, identical amount_received and amount_paid (12,843.2), and the timing (dayofweek=5, hour=12) adds further upward pressure on the score. The sending bank (from_bank=147241) partly offsets risk but not enough to overcome the strong ACH and amount contributions.\n- Conditional/hedged note: If a transaction is ACH with the same ~12,843.2 amount paid and received and occurs at dayofweek=5 around hour=12, the model is likely to increase the flag score substantially; conversely, having from_bank=147241 tends to reduce the score."
