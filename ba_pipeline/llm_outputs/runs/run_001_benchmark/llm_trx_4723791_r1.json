  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — largest positive contribution (SHAP +3.10029, direction: increase). The model’s strongest signal is that this is an ACH-format payment.\n- dayofweek (value=6 → Sun) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.690859, direction: increase). The transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) increased the score.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.539768, direction: increase). Payment currency being Saudi Riyal contributed to the flag.\n- amount_received (value=37845.1) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.449538, direction: increase). A received amount of 37,845.1 (receiving currency) raised the score.\n- from_bank (value=48308) — negative contribution (SHAP -0.528605, direction: decrease). The sending bank ID 48308 partially reduced the flagging score.\n- hour (value=5) — negative contribution (SHAP -0.347968, direction: decrease). The transaction hour (05:00) lowered the score somewhat.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.2554, direction: increase). The receiving currency being Saudi Riyal contributed positively.\n\nConclusion:\n- The flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (payment_format_ach=1) with supporting increases from dayofweek=6 (Sunday), payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1, amount_received=37845.1, and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1. These positive contributors outweigh the partial decreases associated with from_bank=48308 and hour=5.\n- If one treats these drivers as indicative, the model’s decision appears to be mainly associated with an ACH transfer in Saudi Riyals occurring on day 6 with a moderately large amount; the sending bank ID and early-hour timing modestly offset but do not eliminate the overall increase."
