  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) — SHAP 2.88604 (direction: increase): the single largest positive contributor; the ACH payment format is the primary driver pushing the model toward flagging.\n- amount_received (value=13966.5) — SHAP 0.75703 (direction: increase): a mid five‑figure received amount added materially to the flag score.\n- amount_paid (value=13966.5) — SHAP 0.66110 (direction: increase): the paid amount (equal to the received amount) also increased the score.\n- to_bank (value=1547) — SHAP 0.31414 (direction: increase): the receiving bank identifier contributed a smaller positive effect.\n- receiving_currency_euro (value=1) — SHAP -0.27152 (direction: decrease): receiving in EUR reduced the score somewhat.\n- hour (value=12) — SHAP 0.25417 (direction: increase): the transaction hour added a small positive contribution.\n\nConclusion:\nBased solely on the listed drivers, the model flagged the transaction primarily because payment_format_ach=1 combined with mid five‑figure amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 13,966.5) increased the risk score; to_bank and hour provided additional upward pressure, while receiving_currency_euro=1 partially offset the score. If these feature values hold, the net effect of the cited drivers explains why the transaction was flagged."
