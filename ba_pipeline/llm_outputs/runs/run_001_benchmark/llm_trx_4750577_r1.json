  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 — this feature had the largest positive contribution (SHAP +2.85195) and therefore strongly increased the model’s predicted risk/alert score.\n- amount_paid = 8884.75 (SHAP +0.83633) — the payment size contributed positively to the alert.\n- amount_received = 8884.75 (SHAP +0.734996) — the received amount also contributed positively and is consistent with the paid amount driving the score upward.\n- dayofweek = 6 (Sunday) (SHAP +0.716852) — transaction timing on Sunday increased the model score.\n- from_bank = 29251 (SHAP −0.513975) — this sending bank ID reduced the model score, partially offsetting the increases above.\n\nConclusion:\n- The transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) of ~8,884.75 (amount_paid and amount_received) that occurred on a Sunday (dayofweek=6); these features increased the model’s alert score. The sending bank (from_bank=29251) lowered the score somewhat but did not fully offset the positive contributions.\n- If the model treats ACH method and Sunday timing as higher-risk signals, their presence here likely explains the alert."
