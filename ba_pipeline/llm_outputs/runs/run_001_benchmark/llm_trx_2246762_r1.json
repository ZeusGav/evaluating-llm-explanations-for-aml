  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) produced the largest positive contribution (SHAP=+2.97763, direction=increase), so the model’s strongest driver for flagging is that the payment was sent as ACH.\n- amount_paid (value=7257.05) contributed positively (SHAP=+0.993532, direction=increase), indicating the payment size increased the flag score.\n- dayofweek (value=6 — Sunday) contributed positively (SHAP=+0.802643, direction=increase), so the transaction occurring on day 6 raised the score.\n- to_bank (value=12) had a smaller positive effect (SHAP=+0.337979, direction=increase), meaning the receiving bank ID modestly increased the score.\n- hour (value=19) had a negative contribution (SHAP=–0.405103, direction=decrease), and from_bank (value=23691) also lowered the score (SHAP=–0.31674, direction=decrease); these partially offset the positive drivers but did not outweigh them.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged the transaction primarily because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) of 7,257.05 (amount_paid) occurring on day 6 (Sunday), with an additional positive contribution from to_bank=12. Although hour=19 and from_bank=23691 reduced the score, the net SHAP contributions remain positive, producing the alert.\n- If prioritizing review steps, focus first on the payment method (payment_format_ach=1), the payment amount (amount_paid=7257.05), the day of week (dayofweek=6), and the receiving bank (to_bank=12), since these are the strongest model drivers."
