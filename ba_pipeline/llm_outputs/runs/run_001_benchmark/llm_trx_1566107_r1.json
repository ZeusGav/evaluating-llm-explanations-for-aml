  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (payment_format_ach) — strong positive contribution to the alert (SHAP +2.7343). The model’s top driver was that the payment used the ACH format, which substantially increased the score.\n- amount_paid = 16269.7 (amount_paid) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.9757). The payment amount materially increased the score.\n- amount_received = 16269.7 (amount_received) — positive contribution (SHAP +0.9127). The received amount (equal to the paid amount) also materially increased the score.\n- to_bank = 10 (to_bank) — moderate positive contribution (SHAP +0.4243). The receiving bank identifier contributed to increasing the score.\n- dayofweek = 4 (dayofweek) — moderate negative contribution (SHAP −0.4583). The transaction occurring on day 4 reduced the overall score somewhat.\n\nConclusion:\n- The alert is primarily driven by the combination of an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) and relatively large amounts (amount_paid and amount_received = 16269.7), with additional uplift from the receiving bank (to_bank=10). The fact that the transaction occurred on dayofweek=4 partially offset the score.\n- Based solely on these drivers, a focused review of the ACH payment details and the receiving bank (to_bank=10) is warranted, since those features produced the largest positive model contributions."
