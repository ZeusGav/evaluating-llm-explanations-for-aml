  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.74305, direction: increase): the use of ACH is the single largest driver raising the model score.\n- to_bank = 20 (SHAP +0.959191, direction: increase): funds directed to receiving bank ID 20 materially increase the score.\n- amount_paid = 3501.5 (SHAP +0.77653, direction: increase): the payment size contributes to a higher score.\n- dayofweek = 6 (SHAP +0.739734, direction: increase): the transaction occurring on day 6 (Sunday) increases the score.\n- amount_received = 3501.5 (SHAP -0.575362, direction: decrease): the received amount at this value partially offsets the score (reduces the model’s risk signal).\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged mainly because it was an ACH payment (payment_format_ach = 1) routed to receiving bank ID 20 (to_bank = 20), with a payment amount of 3501.5 occurring on dayofweek = 6; these factors↑ (especially ACH) raised the model score. This increase was partially offset by amount_received = 3501.5 which lowered the score. Based solely on these drivers, the case may warrant review because the model’s highest positive contributors are the payment method (ACH), destination bank, amount_paid, and weekend timing."
