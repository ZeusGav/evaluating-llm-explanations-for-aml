  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.94866, direction: increase): The model’s largest positive contributor is that the payment used ACH, which strongly raised the alert score.\n- amount_paid = 13218.8 (SHAP +0.852751, direction: increase) and amount_received = 13218.8 (SHAP +0.830426, direction: increase): Both the payment and receiving amounts (each 13,218.8) materially increased the risk score.\n- from_bank = 4259 (SHAP −0.767747, direction: decrease): The sending bank (ID 4259) reduced the score, partially offsetting other drivers.\n- to_bank = 20 (SHAP +0.704146, direction: increase): The receiving bank (ID 20) contributed positively to the alert.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because it was an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) with moderately large amounts (amount_paid and amount_received = 13,218.8 each), and the receiving bank (to_bank = 20) increased the score; the sending bank (from_bank = 4259) slightly lowered the score but did not negate the stronger risk drivers. If further review is needed, focus checks on the ACH nature of the transfer and the receiving bank (to_bank = 20), since those features drove the alert most."
