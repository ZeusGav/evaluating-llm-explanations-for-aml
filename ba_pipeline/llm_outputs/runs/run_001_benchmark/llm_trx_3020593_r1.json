  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The model’s strongest positive driver is payment_format_ach (payment_format_ach = 1; SHAP 2.89162, direction = increase), so the use of ACH materially raised the alert score.\n- The transaction amount signals contributed positively: amount_paid (11972.8; SHAP 0.889744, increase) and amount_received (11972.8; SHAP 0.787085, increase) both increased the score.\n- hour (12; SHAP 0.300213, increase) gave a small additional upward contribution.\n- Partially offsetting these were from_bank (from_bank = 11056; SHAP -0.336469, decrease) and receiving_currency_euro (receiving_currency_euro = 1; SHAP -0.193893, decrease), which modestly reduced the score.\n\nConclusion:\n- The alert is primarily driven by payment_format_ach = 1 together with the relatively large amount (amount_paid = amount_received = 11972.8), with a small additional contribution from hour = 12. These factors explain why the model flagged the transaction. The sending bank (from_bank = 11056) and the receiving currency being euro (receiving_currency_euro = 1) reduced the model score somewhat; if further review is needed, focus first on the ACH method and the payment size."
