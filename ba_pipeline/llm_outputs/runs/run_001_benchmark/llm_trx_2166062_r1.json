  "llm_text": "Why:\n- The primary contributor is payment_format_ach (value=1), which has the largest positive SHAP (2.74815, direction=increase). This payment method drove the model score up most strongly.\n- amount_paid (value=10148.7) contributed positively (SHAP=0.916798, direction=increase), indicating the transaction size increased the score.\n- dayofweek (value=6, i.e., Sunday) also increased the score (SHAP=0.882412, direction=increase), so the transaction occurring on day 6 contributed to the flag.\n- to_bank (value=22) contributed positively (SHAP=0.79381, direction=increase), indicating that transfers to bank 22 increased the score.\n- amount_received (value=10148.7) contributed positively as well (SHAP=0.578354, direction=increase), i.e., the received amount increases the score consistent with the paid amount.\n- from_bank (value=24850) had a negative SHAP (−0.813136, direction=decrease), meaning the sending bank ID 24850 reduced the model score (partially offsetting other increases).\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction principally because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) of ~10,148.7 (amount_paid and amount_received = 10148.7) on dayofweek=6 (Sunday) to to_bank=22; these features had the largest positive SHAP contributions. The sending bank (from_bank=24850) reduced the score somewhat (negative SHAP).\n- If one assumes the model treats payment_format_ach as higher-risk (implied by its large positive SHAP) and that transfers to to_bank=22 and transactions on dayofweek=6 are associated with higher scores, then those combined with the transaction amount explain why this item was flagged."
