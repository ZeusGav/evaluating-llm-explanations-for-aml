  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Multiple features lower concern \u2014 the amount_ratio is near one, the absolute paid amount is very small, the sending and receiving bank IDs and payment format indicators point away from risk. A small increase in concern comes from the amount_received and that the payment is not in US dollars, but these are minor compared with the lowering signals.\n\nkey_factors:\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion): amount_paid nearly equals amount_received, which could be consistent with a straightforward single transfer.\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion): the very small payment amount could be consistent with routine low\u2011value activity.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): the sending bank ID reduces concern, which might reflect expected bank routing.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): a nonzero received amount could indicate inbound activity that may require contextual explanation.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (raises suspicion): the payment not being in USD could be consistent with cross\u2011currency movement that sometimes merits review.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these small, near\u2011equal amounts and the specific bank IDs are normal for this relationship, the pattern might reflect routine conversion or remittance rather than illicit activity."
