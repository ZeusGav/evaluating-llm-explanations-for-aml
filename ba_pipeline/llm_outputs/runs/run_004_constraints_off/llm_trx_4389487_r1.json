  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness score is driven mainly by an ACH payment of a relatively large, identical amount paid and received in Saudi riyals that occurred on a Sunday and was not in US dollars; these factors raise concern, while two specific bank identifiers slightly reduce the overall suspicion.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion): An ACH payment could be consistent with automated or batch transfers that, depending on context, may be used to move funds quickly between accounts.\n- dayofweek=6 (raises suspicion): A transaction on Sunday might be atypical for standard business activity in some jurisdictions and could merit closer contextual review.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion): Payment currency being Saudi riyal could indicate activity tied to that currency area, which may be relevant depending on the customer's normal profile.\n- amount_received=59658.8 (raises suspicion): A relatively large received amount could increase concern if it is unusual for the customer or account history.\n- from_bank=119 (lowers suspicion): The specific sending bank ID reduces the score, which could reflect a known or lower-risk counterparty relationship in some contexts.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion): Receiving currency also being Saudi riyal reinforces concentration in that currency, which may be notable if outside the account\u2019s typical behavior.\n- amount_paid=59658.8 (raises suspicion): The paid amount matching the received amount could suggest a direct single-leg transfer of significant value, which may warrant attention depending on expectations.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion): The payment not being in US dollars may be notable if the customer typically transacts in USD or if USD avoidance is relevant to the risk context.\n- to_bank=49365 (lowers suspicion): The specific receiving bank ID slightly reduces suspicion, which might indicate a familiar or lower-risk destination bank in certain scenarios.\n- payment_format_credit_card=0 (raises suspicion): Not being a credit card payment (i.e., a non-card transfer) increases relevance for cash-movement typologies that rely on bank-to-bank transfers.\n\ninvestigation_context: Taken together, these factors could be consistent with legitimate cross-border or currency-specific business payments (for example, payroll or supplier settlement in Saudi riyals), particularly if such activity matches the customer\u2019s normal patterns; alternatively, an ACH transfer on a Sunday for a substantial amount in SAR that is not in USD might indicate atypical fund movement or layering if it departs from expected behavior."
