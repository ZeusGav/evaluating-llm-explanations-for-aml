  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is very low because every listed attribute of this transaction points toward lower concern: the payment originated from from_bank=1490, was credit-card funded rather than ACH or bitcoin, involved a modest amount (208.56) received in euros late in the evening on dayofweek=4 to to_bank=22775. No listed factor increases suspicion; together these factors could be consistent with a routine consumer payment.\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank=1490 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 if the sender is from this bank ID, that origin aligns with the other benign attributes and may reflect an expected source.\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 absence of ACH in this transaction could be consistent with alternative, lower-risk payment rails in this context.\n- payment_format_credit_card=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 being credit-card funded may indicate a consumer-style payment method rather than riskier channels.\n- amount_paid=208.56 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 a modest payment amount could be consistent with routine retail or service transactions rather than large-value outliers.\n- hour=21 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 occurring at 21:00 may be consistent with normal evening consumer activity rather than atypical timing signals.\n- receiving_currency_euro=1 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 receipt in euros may align with normal cross-border or domestic business in that currency rather than an unusual currency choice.\n- dayofweek=4 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 happening on day 4 (Thursday) may fit ordinary weekday transaction patterns.\n- to_bank=22775 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank ID in combination with the other factors is indicative of a routine counterparty relationship in this record.\n- amount_received=208.56 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 matching received and paid amounts suggests a straightforward transfer without complex value dissipation.\n- payment_currency_bitcoin=0 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 not using bitcoin may be consistent with conventional fiat payment behavior.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes accurately describe the transaction, the low suspiciousness score may reflect a straightforward, credit-card-funded payment of \u20ac208.56 late on a weekday between the specified banks, which could be consistent with routine consumer or merchant activity; absence of any listed raising factors does not itself evaluate risks not captured here."
