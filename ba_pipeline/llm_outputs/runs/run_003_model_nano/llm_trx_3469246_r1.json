  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Overall, the suspiciousness score is very low, driven by numerous decreasing indicators, with only modest increases from amount_received and cheque payments that slightly elevate suspicion. The balance of evidence leans toward lower risk, though the two increases warrant limited attention.\nkey_factors:\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion): could indicate that amounts paid and received are tightly aligned, reducing anomaly.\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion): may reflect typical expense payments rather than unusual transfers.\n- payment_format_cheque (raises suspicion): use of cheque could indicate non-electronic settlement, which might warrant closer look.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): the incoming amount received shows a pattern that could be more scrutinized.\n- payment_format_bitcoin (lowers suspicion): in this context, bitcoin-based payments may reflect legitimate digital settlement, lowering suspicion.\ninvestigation_context: If these patterns persist, they could be consistent with normal business flows rather than high-risk activity."
