  "llm_text": "short_explanation: All listed factors contribute to lowering suspicion, with every signal indicating a non-risky pattern, and no factors raising suspicion observed. The combination of matched amounts, US-dollar usage, and conventional payment methods supports a low-suspicion assessment.\nkey_factors:\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion) could reflect a standard payment amount and routine settlement.\n- amount_received (lowers suspicion) could indicate matching receipt amount in a routine transaction.\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion) could reflect a 1:1 payment-to-receipt ratio, common in normal transfers.\n- payment_format_ach (lowers suspicion) could indicate non-ACH usage, reducing ACH-specific risk in this context.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (lowers suspicion) could reflect USD usage, consistent with domestic settlement patterns.\ninvestigation_context: If these patterns persist, the overall assessment would remain aligned with a low-suspicion scenario."
