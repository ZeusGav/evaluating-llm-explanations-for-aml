  "llm_text": "Why:\nThe alert is primarily driven by payment_format_ach = 1 (strong positive contribution), indicating an ACH payment increased the model score. Secondary positive drivers are amount_paid = 16269.7 and amount_received = 16269.7 (both increased the score), showing a relatively large, equal paid and received amount. dayofweek = 4 contributed negatively (decreased the score), partially offsetting risk. to_bank = 10 had a smaller positive effect (increased the score).\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged the transaction mainly because payment_format_ach = 1 combined with sizable, matching amount_paid and amount_received increased risk. This is somewhat offset by dayofweek = 4. If ACH transfers of this magnitude and symmetry to to_bank = 10 are atypical for the customer, further review is warranted; otherwise the flag may reflect expected ACH activity."
