  "llm_text": "Why:\nThe model flag is driven most strongly by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+3.028), indicating an ACH payment format strongly increased the score. Large amounts also increased the score: amount_received (value=17119.9; SHAP=+0.742) and amount_paid (value=17119.9; SHAP=+0.495). The sending bank (from_bank, value=118; SHAP=-0.575) modestly reduced the score. Day of week (dayofweek, value=5 i.e., Saturday; SHAP=+0.389) further increased the score.\n\nConclusion:\nPrimarily because payment_format_ach=1 combined with relatively high amount_received/amount_paid (17119.9) and occurrence on dayofweek=5 (Saturday) raised the model score, the transaction was flagged. The from_bank=118 partially offset risk. If ACH payments and high same-valued amount fields are treated as higher-risk by the model, this explains the alert."
