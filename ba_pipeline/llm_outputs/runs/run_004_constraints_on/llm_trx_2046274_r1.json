  "llm_text": "Why:\nThe flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.85887, direction=increase), meaning an ACH payment heavily raised the model score. Large transaction size contributed: amount_received (16450.3; SHAP=+0.994091, direction=increase) and amount_paid (16450.3; SHAP=+0.614774, direction=increase). Timing features also influenced the score: dayofweek (5; SHAP=+0.402226, direction=increase) increased the score, while hour (20; SHAP=-0.364302, direction=decrease) reduced it. A smaller positive contribution came from to_bank (14804; SHAP=+0.220654, direction=increase).\n\nConclusion:\nThe model flagged this transaction mainly due to ACH payment format combined with relatively large, equal amounts received/paid and occurrence on dayofweek=5. If further review is needed, focus on ACH routing details for to_bank (14804) and the large amounts; note that the late hour (hour=20) slightly offsets the score."
