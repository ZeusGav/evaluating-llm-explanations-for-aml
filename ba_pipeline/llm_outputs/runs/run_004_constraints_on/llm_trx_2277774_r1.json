  "llm_text": "Why:\nThe model flagged the transaction mainly because payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.765), which strongly increased the score, together with elevated amounts: amount_received = 19693.8 (SHAP +1.209) and amount_paid = 19693.8 (SHAP +0.668), both pushing the prediction upward. Dayofweek = 6 (SHAP +0.600) also increased risk contribution. Offsetting factors with negative contributions were hour = 23 (SHAP -0.517) and from_bank = 111443 (SHAP -0.350), which reduced the overall score.\n\nConclusion:\nThe alert is driven principally by ACH payment format and identical, sizable payment/receipt amounts on dayofweek = 6. Given the net positive SHAP contributions from payment_format_ach and the amounts, the model flagged the transaction despite partial reductions from hour and from_bank. If further review is needed, focus on ACH context and the specific amount values cited above."
