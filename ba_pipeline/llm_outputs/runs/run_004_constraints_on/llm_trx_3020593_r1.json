  "llm_text": "Why: The model score was driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP +2.89162 → large increase). Large transaction size — amount_paid (11972.8; SHAP +0.889744) and amount_received (11972.8; SHAP +0.787085) — further increased the score. hour (12; SHAP +0.300213) provided a smaller positive contribution. Offsetting contributors included from_bank (11056; SHAP −0.336469) and receiving_currency_euro (1; SHAP −0.193893), which modestly reduced the score.\n\nConclusion: The flag appears driven mainly by the ACH payment channel combined with substantial, equal paid/received amounts (payment_format_ach, amount_paid, amount_received), with minor amplification from the transaction hour. Given the negative contributions from from_bank and receiving_currency_euro, the overall concern is elevated but not solely driven by banking origin or currency. If one accepts the model’s feature importances, this combination warrants manual review focusing on the ACH flow and the sizable, matched amounts."
