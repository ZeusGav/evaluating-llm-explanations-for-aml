  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach (value=1) is the dominant driver increasing the score (shap=2.87717).\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1, shap=0.638912) and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1, shap=0.317249) further increase the score.\n- amount_received (60777.8) contributes positively (shap=0.606884).\n- from_bank (150240) has a negative effect (shap=-0.492466), partially offsetting the increases.\n\nConclusion:\nThe alert is primarily driven by an ACH payment in Saudi Riyals combined with a sizable received amount (60777.8) — these features (payment_format_ach, payment_currency_saudi_riyal, receiving_currency_saudi_riyal, amount_received) raised the model score despite a dampening effect from from_bank. If one is assessing risk operationally, one may (conditionally) consider the ACH+SAR+high-amount pattern as the core rationale for review, noting the sending bank feature reduced but did not eliminate the model’s signal."
