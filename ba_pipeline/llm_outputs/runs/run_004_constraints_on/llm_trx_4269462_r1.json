  "llm_text": "Why: The flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.9789 → large increase), indicating an ACH payment strongly raised the model score. Currency-related features also increased the score: payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1; SHAP=+0.5160) and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1; SHAP=+0.2707). The amount_received (value=49149.3; SHAP=+0.4204) further increased the score. Partially offsetting these was from_bank (value=148016; SHAP=-0.4493 → decreases score).\n\nConclusion: The transaction was flagged mainly because it is an ACH transfer in Saudi riyals with a sizable received amount (drivers: payment_format_ach, payment_currency_saudi_riyal, receiving_currency_saudi_riyal, amount_received). The sending bank (from_bank) moderately reduced the model score but did not outweigh the increases. If ACH + SAR + ~49k SAR persist, the model is likely to flag similar transactions."
