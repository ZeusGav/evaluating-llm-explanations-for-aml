  "llm_text": "Why: The model flag is driven primarily by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=2.8279; direction=increase), indicating use of an ACH payment was the single largest contributor. Secondary contributors were amount_received (17441.1; SHAP=0.9197; increase) and amount_paid (17441.1; SHAP=0.5926; increase), so relatively large and equal paid/received amounts raised the score. Additional upward contributors were to_bank (1467; SHAP=0.2931; increase) and dayofweek (1; SHAP=0.0999; increase).\n\nConclusion: Based only on the named drivers, the transaction was flagged mainly because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach=1) involving matching high amounts (amount_received and amount_paid = 17441.1) routed to to_bank=1467 on dayofweek=1. If further review is warranted, consider verifying ACH originator/authentication and details for to_bank=1467, as these factors directly increased the model score."
