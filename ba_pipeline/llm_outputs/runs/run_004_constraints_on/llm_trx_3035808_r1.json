  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.8739): the ACH payment format is the largest single contributor increasing the model score.  \n- amount_received = 12843.2 (SHAP +1.03098) and amount_paid = 12843.2 (SHAP +0.605992): the sizable, equal payment amounts further raised the score.  \n- from_bank = 147241 (SHAP -0.523827): the sending bank feature partially reduced the score (attenuating effect).  \n- dayofweek = 5 (SHAP +0.453197) and hour = 12 (SHAP +0.24078): transaction timing provided additional, smaller increases.\n\nConclusion:\nThe transaction was flagged primarily because payment_format_ach (1) combined with large amount_received and amount_paid values increased the model’s risk signal; from_bank (147241) modestly offset that signal. If investigating, prioritize review of the ACH nature and the matched large amounts, noting timing (dayofweek=5, hour=12) as secondary context."
