  "llm_text": "Why:\n- payment_format_ach = 1 (SHAP +2.8416): the payment being ACH was the single largest positive driver of the flag.\n- amount_received = 17498.0 (SHAP +1.02106): the received amount materially increased the score.\n- amount_paid = 17498.0 (SHAP +0.650169): the paid amount, equal to amount_received, further increased the score.\n- to_bank = 12 (SHAP +0.458209): routing to receiving bank ID 12 contributed to the increase.\n\nConclusion:\n- The model flagged this transaction primarily because it is an ACH transfer (payment_format_ach) combined with identical amount_paid and amount_received (17,498.0) and routing to to_bank = 12, which together raised the alert score. \n- If one accepts the model signals, the ACH method plus matching paid/received amounts appears to be the key pattern driving the alert."
