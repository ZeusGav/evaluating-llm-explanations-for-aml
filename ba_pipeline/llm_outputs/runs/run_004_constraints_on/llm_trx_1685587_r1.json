  "llm_text": "Why: The model flag is driven mainly by payment_format_ach (value=1; SHAP=+2.98) which strongly increases the score. Additional positive contributors are payment_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1; SHAP=+0.57), amount_received (value=28639.8; SHAP=+0.40), receiving_currency_saudi_riyal (value=1; SHAP=+0.23), and dayofweek (value=5; SHAP=+0.22) — each of these features increased the predicted risk. The from_bank feature (value=49365; SHAP=-0.47) reduced the score, partially offsetting increases.\n\nConclusion: The transaction was flagged primarily because it is an ACH payment (payment_format_ach=1) in Saudi riyal (payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 and receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1) with a substantial received amount (amount_received=28639.8) occurring on dayofweek=5. The sending bank (from_bank) lowered the model score but did not fully negate the strong ACH and currency/amount effects."
