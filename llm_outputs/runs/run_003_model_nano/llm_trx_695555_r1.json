  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Most factors lower suspicion overall. However, the increase in amount_received and the use of bitcoin as the payment currency could raise concern.\n\nkey_factors:\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) could reflect inbound funds needing closer review when seen with other indicators.\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion) near 1 suggests a balanced flow, reducing concern.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion) sending bank appears routine, which lowers risk in isolation.\n- payment_currency_bitcoin (raises suspicion) use of bitcoin as the payment currency may indicate higher-risk activity.\n- payment_format_bitcoin (lowers suspicion) bitcoin-related payment format reduces concern in this context.\n\ninvestigation_context: If inbound amount_received and bitcoin-related indicators occur together with routine signals, the overall suspiciousness could remain low."
