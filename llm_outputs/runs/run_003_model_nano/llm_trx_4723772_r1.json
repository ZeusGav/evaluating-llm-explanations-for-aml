A sending-from-bank signal lowers the concern, shaping the overall level of risk.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion) could reflect the use of ACH and may signal higher-risk activity.\n- dayofweek=6 (raises suspicion) weekend timing could indicate unusual activity.\n- amount_received=31774.2 (raises suspicion) a relatively large sum entering.\n- receiving_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion) receiving in Saudi Riyal suggests cross-border currency flow.\n- from_bank=48308 (lowers suspicion) sending bank could be a lower-risk counterpart.\ninvestigation_context: If these factors are present, the activity could be considered highly suspicious and warrant closer investigation."
