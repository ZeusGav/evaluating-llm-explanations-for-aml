Specifically, use of ACH and a relatively larger amount paid increase suspicion but are outweighed by the lowering factors.\n\nkey_factors:\n- amount_diff (lowers suspicion): a small absolute difference between amount_paid and amount_received could be consistent with an expected settlement between parties.\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion): a ratio near 1 may indicate that paid and received values align as expected for the transaction.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): the sending bank identifier may reflect routine counterparty routing rather than unusual routing.\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion): ACH format (raises suspicion) could, in some contexts, be associated with automated or higher\u2011throughput payment channels.\n- amount_paid (raises suspicion): a relatively higher amount_paid (raises suspicion) could, depending on context, reflect greater monetary value that merits attention.\n\ninvestigation_context: If viewed in context, the mix of matching amounts and bank IDs with ACH format and a higher paid amount could be consistent with routine high\u2011value transfers or, alternatively, with transactions needing further contextual information."
