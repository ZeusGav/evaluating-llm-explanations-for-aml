  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is high because multiple incoming-payment attributes \u2014 notably payment_format_ach=1, payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1, and a large amount_received \u2014 collectively raise concern about this transaction pattern. Some factors, such as from_bank=150240 and to_bank=48309, lower suspicion but do not fully offset the raising indicators. \nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 an ACH payment method could be consistent with automated or bulk transfers that may require closer review.\n- payment_currency_saudi_riyal=1 (raises suspicion) \u2014 use of Saudi riyal for the payment may indicate currency routing patterns worth attention.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) \u2014 a relatively large received amount could be consistent with higher-value activity that increases risk.\n- from_bank=150240 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the sending bank identifier is associated here with a reducing effect, which might reflect a routine source.\n- to_bank=48309 (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank identifier slightly reduces concern, possibly indicating a familiar counterparty.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes are accurate, the combination of ACH format, Saudi riyal currency, and high amount could be consistent with elevated transaction risk and may warrant contextual review."
