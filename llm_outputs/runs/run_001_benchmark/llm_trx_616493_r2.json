  "llm_text": "short_explanation: Most strong indicators lower suspicion \u2014 the sending bank, non-ACH cheque format, small payment amount, and US dollar currency push the score down, while the receiving bank identifier and the morning hour provide minor upward pressure. Overall, the combination of mostly lowering signals with only slight raises results in a very low suspiciousness score.\n\nkey_factors:\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): could reflect a routine sender profile associated with lower concern.\n- payment_format_cheque (lowers suspicion): could be consistent with a standard cheque payment process.\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion): could indicate a low-value transfer that reduces immediate concern.\n- to_bank (raises suspicion): could reflect concentration toward a particular recipient bank that merits attention.\n- hour (raises suspicion): could reflect timing patterns (morning) that slightly increase scrutiny.\n\ninvestigation_context: If reviewed, these factors could be consistent with a small routine cheque payment to the receiving bank, with only modest concerns about that bank identifier and the morning timing."
