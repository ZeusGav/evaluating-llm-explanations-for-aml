  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The overall score is very low because multiple transaction attributes\u2014cash payment, absence of ACH routing, Swiss franc as receiving currency, the sending/receiving bank indicators, the time/day and the received amount\u2014collectively lower concern. A single factor (payment_currency_us_dollar=0) slightly raises concern by indicating the payment is not in US dollars, but its effect is small compared with the lowering factors.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_cash=1 (lowers suspicion): receiving as cash could be consistent with routine cash activity and reduces automated-transfer concerns.\n- payment_format_ach=0 (lowers suspicion): lack of ACH routing may indicate this was not an automated ACH transfer, decreasing transfer-related risk.\n- receiving_currency_swiss_franc=1 (lowers suspicion): use of Swiss francs may align with expected settlement currency and lower currency-related concern.\n- amount_received=26036.8 (lowers suspicion): the payment amount may be consistent with normal business or personal transfers, reducing anomaly signals.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar=0 (raises suspicion): not being in US dollars could reflect an atypical currency choice and slightly increases concern.\n\ninvestigation_context: If more customer or counterparty context were available, the mix of mostly lowering factors and a minor increasing factor could be interpreted as consistent with routine activity but would benefit from contextual review."
