  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The high suspiciousness is driven largely by an ACH payment of substantial size in Saudi riyal occurring on a Sunday, while specific sending and receiving bank identifiers modestly reduce concern. Strong signals from payment format, amounts, currency and timing raise concern overall, offset slightly by bank routing indicators that may reflect known counterparties.\n\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion): ACH method could be consistent with automated or batch transfers that warrant closer scrutiny.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion): A large received amount may indicate significant value movement requiring attention.\n- dayofweek (raises suspicion): A transaction on Sunday may indicate activity outside typical weekday patterns.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion): The specific sending bank ID may lower concern if it corresponds to a known, vetted originator.\n- to_bank (lowers suspicion): The specific receiving bank ID may lower concern if it aligns with expected destination relationships.\n\ninvestigation_context: If these indicators are validated, the combination could be consistent with high-value cross-border flows that may merit further contextual review."
