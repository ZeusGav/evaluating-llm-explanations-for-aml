  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is very low because several features lower suspicion, including a near\u2011one amount_ratio, a very small amount_paid, and specific sending/receiving bank IDs. A couple of features slightly raise suspicion \u2014 the amount_received value and the payment not being in US dollars \u2014 but their influence is minor compared with the lowering factors. \nkey_factors:\n- amount_ratio (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the paid-to-received ratio is almost 1.0, which could be consistent with a straightforward pass-through transfer.\n- amount_paid (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the payment size is very small, which could be consistent with low-risk, routine activity.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the sending bank ID aligns with other lowering signals and may indicate a known counterparty.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) \u2014 the received amount shows some influence toward concern and could merit contextual review.\n- payment_currency_us_dollar (raises suspicion) \u2014 payment is not in US dollars, which might reflect cross-currency activity requiring context.\ninvestigation_context: If further review is performed, these factors could collectively suggest routine small transfers but may still warrant contextual checks given the non\u2011USD element."
