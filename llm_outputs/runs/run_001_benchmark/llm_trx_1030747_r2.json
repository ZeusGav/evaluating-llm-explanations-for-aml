  "llm_text": "short_explanation: The score is high because the transaction used ACH, involved a large received/paid amount, occurred on a Sunday, and used Saudi riyal as the currency, all of which raise suspicion. These signals are partially offset by the specific sending and receiving bank identifiers, which lower suspicion.\nkey_factors:\n- payment_format_ach (raises suspicion) \u2014 the use of ACH could be consistent with automated or high-volume transfer channels and is notable.\n- amount_received (raises suspicion) \u2014 the sizable received amount could be consistent with higher-value activity that may attract attention.\n- dayofweek (raises suspicion) \u2014 occurrence on a Sunday could reflect atypical timing for normal business flows.\n- from_bank (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the sending bank identifier reduces the score, which might reflect a known or lower-risk origin.\n- to_bank (lowers suspicion) \u2014 the receiving bank identifier reduces the score, which might reflect a routine destination.\ninvestigation_context: If these attributes are accurate, they could be consistent with a high-value ACH payment in Saudi riyal occurring on a weekend and may indicate elevated transaction risk."
